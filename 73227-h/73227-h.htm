<p><span class="drop-cap">T</span>HE Nibelungen Lied (<i>Nibelungen</i>, name
of an ancient royal race which possessed
a great treasure; <i>lied</i>, song or ballad), one
of the world’s greatest epics, made its
appearance in the twelfth or thirteenth century, in
South Germany. Its authorship is unknown. The
writer, however, did not produce an original work,
but made use of still earlier legends which had been
handed down orally. The Nibelungen Lied is to
be regarded, therefore, as a collection of ballads
skilfully united so as to form a connected story.
Its hero is Siegfried, who possessed the Nibelung
hoard, which he won in Norway. Siegfried wooed
Brunhild for Günther, King of Burgundy, and married
the king’s sister, Kriemhild. He was treacherously
slain by Hagen and the hoard was sunk in
the Rhine. Kriemhild subsequently was married
to Etzel (Attila), King of the Huns, and slew Hagen
after he had been overcome in combat, but lost her
own life at the hands of the “ancient,” Hildebrand.
Both historical and mythical elements are mingled
in this great poem, which should not be confounded
with Wagner’s “Ring der Nibelungen,” in which
he has taken many names from the German epic.
The material for his famous music-dramas he found<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vi">[vi]</span>
in the old Norse version, contained in the Volsunga
Saga and the Edda.</p>

<p>The Nibelungen Lied was followed by many similar
epics, among them “Gudrun,” “The Expedition
of Ecken,” the tale of “King Laurin,” “Rosengarten,”
and others, but The Nibelungen Lied is
the greatest of all the German national traditions.
One writer, in his description of the poem, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Feudal loyalty and martial courage were the great virtues of
these heroes. The poem contains a tale of revenge; but all the
plot turns on the principle of loyalty, in obedience to which
thousands lost their lives in a quarrel which had at first involved
only two or three leading characters. Though this singular poem
contains many traits of a warlike age, and closes with terrible
scenes of carnage, it displays hardly a trace of such a motive as
personal hatred, except in the character of the heroine.”</p>
</div>

<p>Considered as types, Siegfried stands for the enthusiasm,
beauty, courage, lofty purpose, and high
ambition of immortal youth; Hagen, for fierceness,
boldness, savagery, and treachery; Kriemhild is the
type of a gentle, loving nature roused to the highest
intensity of furious longing for vengeance. Old
as the poem is, it contains the development of all
human passions,—manly beauty, heroism, and nobility
by the side of unmanly cruelty and treachery;
the blackest unfaithfulness by the side of faithfulness
until death; the foulest of deeds by the side<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vii">[vii]</span>
of the most loving; and the tenderest hearts combined
with the most heroic souls. But among them
all, no character stands out more resplendently as an
exemplar for youth than Siegfried, himself the type
of immortal youth.</p>

<p>In the making of this translation an older form
of English expression has been employed as in better
keeping, perhaps, with the older form of German,
which was used in the original poem. Some of the
more sanguinary descriptions have been toned down,
some of the numerous poetical connecting links
omitted as being unnecessary, and paragraphs here
and there have also been omitted where this did not
mar the context, so as to make the volume nearly
uniform in size with the others of the series.</p>

<p><span class="drop-cap">I</span>N olden times there lived at Santen on the
Rhine a noble pair, Siegmund and Sieglind,
King and Queen of Niderland, to whom late
in life was born a son. They named the boy
Siegfried, and he throve and grew apace, so that
none could equal him for beauty or strength, and
in all knightly sports and exercises he soon left far
behind him the other lads of his age. Now, these
were the days of heroes whose fame spread far and
wide throughout the world. To listen to tales of
their mighty deeds gave even more joy to the bold
youth than the call of the hunting-horn or the
sound of the battle-trumpet; while to forge good
swords that, like the lions’ teeth, should pierce
through bone and sinew, seemed in truth to him a
noble art.</p>

<p>One day his father, Siegmund the King, told to
him the tale of Wieland the Smith.</p>

<p>The giant Wadi had a son whose evil fortune it
was to be lame, wherefore he besought his father<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
to let him become a smith. “For,” said he, “since
with such limbs as these it is plain I may do no
knightly deeds, what better lot can be mine than
to forge arms fit for heroes to wield?”</p>

<p>“Now hast thou well spoken,” replied Wadi, and
forthwith took his son to Mime. Mime was the
greatest smith in all Hunland, and he kept Wieland
for three years and made him master of his art.
Nor was this all; for, when the time was spent, his
father sent him to two famous dwarfs who dwelt in
the Kallova mountains. These dwarfs were possessed
of marvellous strength and skill, and would
not agree to take Wieland into their forge for a twelve-month
save upon payment of a piece of gold.</p>

<p>At the end of the time Wadi came to fetch his
son. But Wieland already surpassed the dwarfs in
skill and cunning, and they would not let him go.
They said to Wadi:</p>

<p>“Let thy son bide with us for yet another twelve-month,
and thou shalt have back thy gold.” But
to this they craftily added that if by any chance he
should not appear at the time appointed, Wieland’s
head must pay the forfeit. To this the giant agreed;
but ere he set forth he spoke privately with his son,
saying:</p>

<p>“For their own sake they will keep thee yet
another year, and at the end thereof for envy they
will slay thee. Nevertheless their evil designs shall<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
avail them not. Three days before the time will I
be here, but meanwhile that thou mayest not lack
defence, take this sword. Be brave and fearless,
and in thy hand it shall prove a sword of vengeance
against the mighty dwarfs!”</p>

<p>Then Wadi departed; whereupon his son drove
the keen blade into the ground and hid all traces of
it from the sharp eyes of the dwarfs.</p>

<p>Now Wieland plied his craft so lustily, that he
wrought many good swords and pieces of armor,
and the time went swiftly by. Three days before
the end of the year came Wadi; but the mountain
was shut fast, and being weary he lay down before it
and slept. And as he slept the dwarfs came forth
and spied him; whereat they loosened a great rock
from the side of the mountain, so that it rolled down
upon the giant, crushing and killing him. On the
third day they brought Wieland forth from the
mountain and made pretence to watch for Wadi’s
coming. But Wieland saw blood spots on the
ground, and, looking about more closely, perceived
one of his father’s feet protruding from a mass of
rock. Thereupon a frenzy of grief and rage seized
him, and, thrusting his hands into the earth, he
drew out the great sword the giant had left him.
Meanwhile the dwarfs had fetched their own swords
shouting:</p>

<p>“Now must thou die!” But at the sight before<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
them they were stricken with fear, lest he might be
a sorcerer and blast them with his magic.</p>

<p>Wieland gave them no time to recover, but rushed
upon them fiercely, nor could all their skill avail
against his fury. Although attacked from every
side and forced to spring now this way, now that,
to avoid their blows, he soon overcame and slew
both his foes. Thereupon, after binding up his
wounds, he brought out from the mountain a
great store of gold, and, loading this, with all
his tools, upon a horse, set out upon his journey
northward.</p>

<p>At last he came to the sea. Here he felled a
stout tree which grew by the shore, and artfully
hollowed it so that it might hold him with his tools
and treasure, closing it after from within, all save
some small openings which he filled with glass.
And when all was done he rolled himself, with the
tree, into the water, and was borne away by the
wind and waves.</p>

<p>Thus eighteen days went by and but little was
left of his store of meat and honey, when at last the
island of Jutland loomed near at hand. Now it
chanced that some of the King’s folk were fishing
in the sea and they seized the tree-trunk and drew
it to the land. When the King came to look at the
strange craft he bade them cleave it asunder, but at
this Wieland gave such a shout that all who heard<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
were smitten with fear of the spirit dwelling within
the tree,—for so they deemed him. Thereupon
he opened the trunk himself and stepped forth,
offering his service to the King; and the King,
nothing loath to have such a follower, made him
welcome. Henceforth he abode at the court.</p>

<p>Among Wieland’s other duties was the care of
the King’s three best table-knives; and it chanced
one day, after twelve months had passed, that the
sharpest of the knives slipped from his hand and
fell into the sea. He betook himself at once to the
King’s smith, Amilias, and finding no one in the
forge, fell to work and made a new knife so like
the lost one that none could tell it was not the same.
Also he wrought a curious three-edged nail, and this
he left upon the anvil. Scarcely had he gone when
Amilias, the smith, returned, and great was his surprise
to find so strange a thing upon his anvil, nor
could he guess by whose hand it had been forged.
Wieland laid the new knife upon the King’s table
as was his wont, nor did the King perceive the
change. But lo! as he cut his bread, the blade
well-nigh pierced the board. Then the King swore
that no other than Wieland, who had so skilfully
fashioned the tree-boat, could have wrought such
a knife, and Wieland confessed that this was so.
Amilias, the smith, hearing this, was filled with
envy and grew very wroth. He indignantly denied<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
the truth of Wieland’s words, and challenged him
to a trial of skill.</p>

<p>“Now, forsooth, I will set ye the tasks,” out-spoke
the King. “Within the space of twelve
moons thou, Amilias, shalt forge a helm and coat
of mail, and thou, Wieland, a sword. But an thy
sword cleave not Amilias’s helm and mail at one
stroke, then art thou held forsworn and for that thy
head shall fall!”</p>

<p>Forthwith Amilias betook himself to his anvil.
He labored early and late till he had wrought a suit
of armor so strong and heavy that the champion
who should wear it must needs have the strength of
three men. But when half the year was gone not a
blow had Wieland dealt with his hammer. The
King warned him, and caused a forge to be built
for him; yet again the months slipped by and he
paid no heed to his task.</p>

<p>At length when it lacked but two months of the
appointed time, he fell to work and in seven days
had forged a sword. To test its keenness, he held
it in a stream wherein some handfuls of loose wool
had been thrown. As they drifted against the edge
of the blade they were instantly severed; whereat
the King was amazed and acknowledged that never
yet had such a sword been seen. Nor did his
wonder lessen when Wieland began to file the blade
into small bits. These he welded together again<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
and at the end of thirteen days a second sword was
made even sharper than the first. It cut through a
bunch of the floating wool full two feet thick when
it had scarcely touched the edge; and the King pronounced
the sword a priceless treasure.</p>

<p>Yet once again did Wieland file it into bits, and
from the pieces in three more weeks forge a third
sword. The blade, richly inlaid with gold, flashed
like the lightning and would sever a hair that fell
upon its edge, while the handle was set in curious
fashion with precious stones. The King marvelled
greatly at this wondrous feat, and would have kept
the great sword, which was called Mimung, for himself;
but Wieland hid it and soon made another
for the King.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Amilias had wrought a second suit of
armor still heavier and more massive than the first,
and tried its strength with many weapons. But the
keenest swords and heaviest battle-axes could scarce
dent its surface, much less pierce or destroy it.
Wherefore the smith awaited with calmness the
day of the trial, never doubting he should win
the test.</p>

<p>At last the time was come. Amilias strode
haughtily into the great hall, clad in his massive
armor, the mighty helm upon his head, and soon
was obliged to sit upon a stool, so oppressive was
their weight. Then came Wieland, and as he drew<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
his great sword, the whole hall seemed filled with
light. The King and all his chiefs formed a circle
about the two smiths and again the King demanded:</p>

<p>“Was it thou, Wieland, who did forge the
knife?”</p>

<p>And again Wieland answered: “Of a truth, my
lord, it was I.”</p>

<p>Again, too, Amilias denied it, whereupon Wieland
strode to his side, and flung his lying words back
to him. But the smith only laughed a scornful
laugh and said:</p>

<p>“Fool! Soon shall thy false head roll upon the
ground and thereby prove me right!”</p>

<p>Hereupon the King gave the signal. Quick as
thought the good sword Mimung flashed in the air,
and descended so swiftly that none could mark its
flight, cleaving Amilias in twain, through helm
and head, mail and body, and even through the
stool on which he sat. Then Wieland said to the
smith:</p>

<p>“How feelest thou?”</p>

<p>And Amilias replied: “I feel as it were a stream
of ice-cold water had been poured over my body.”</p>

<p>“Shake thyself!” said Wieland; and Amilias
shook himself, whereat, with a great crash down
fell his two halves from the stool, one to the right,
the other to the left.</p>

<p>“It was indeed thou that forged the knife,” cried<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
the King; “henceforth thou shalt be my master
smith!”</p>

<p>And so it came to pass. Nor was there any in
all the land to equal him for skill and cunning; and
from that time Wieland was renowned as the greatest
of all smiths.</p>

<small><i>Dietrich’s Fight with Ecke</i></small></h2>
</div>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/dropcap-n.jpg" width="78" height="75" alt="N">
</div>

<p><span class="drop-cap">N</span>OW, it chanced one day that a knight
of Siegmund’s court returned after long
wandering in foreign lands, and the King
sent for him forthwith, that himself and
his son Siegfried might hear what was toward in the
world without. Thereupon the knight told them
many stirring tales of King Günther, of Hagen the
Grim, of old Hildebrand, and yet others; and the
last was the tale of Dietrich’s Fight with Ecke.</p>

<p>In a distant heathen country there dwelt three
beautiful queens. One day they sat together, and
with them the three mightiest champions in the
land; and they fell to praising the valor of Dietrich
of Bern, of whose deeds great tales were told, and
they vowed he must be the bravest and strongest
knight alive. This greatly vexed the three heroes,
and most of all the greatest of them, who was called
Ecke; and he said:</p>

<p>“In truth unto this day there hath been no man
who could withstand me, nor shall this mighty
Dietrich of Bern!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>At these bold words the queens were glad, and
one said to him:</p>

<p>“An thou shalt overcome Dietrich and bring
him to us alive, so shalt thou choose which one of
us thou wilt for thy wife!”</p>

<p>Then Ecke began forthwith to prepare for his
departure, and did but laugh to scorn a certain
knight who, having seen Dietrich and knowing of
his great prowess, had warned Ecke to take heed
for his life. When all was ready, one of the
queens bestowed on him a coat of mail, the golden
links of which had been toughened by being dipped
in dragon’s blood, and girded him with a shining
sword; the second’s gift was a splendid shield;
while the third placed upon his head a helm of
gold. And there was led forth for him their noblest
steed; but this he refused, saying:</p>

<p>“I will not take the steed, for not long might he
bear my weight; nor is it needful, since for fourteen
days and nights I can fare, knowing neither
hunger nor fatigue.”</p>

<p>Thereupon Ecke set bravely forth and was soon
lost in the depths of the forest, shield and harness
ringing so loudly among the trees that bird and
beast fled before him in affright. After some days’
journeying he learned it was but a day since that
Dietrich had been in Bern (Verona); whereat he
hastened forthwith to that city. When the people<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
beheld the gigantic hero they were stricken with
terror; for the flashing of his armor in the sunlight
was like fire, and they feared lest this mighty being
should set the whole city ablaze. But old Hildebrand,
who had been Dietrich’s master-at-arms, approached
him fearlessly; whereupon Ecke asked
him where Dietrich might be found, and Hildebrand
said:</p>

<p>“It was but yestermorn that Dietrich rode hence
toward the Tyrol. Seek him there an thou wilt,
bold knight; methinks he will not avoid thee!”</p>

<p>So Ecke hastened after on the road which Dietrich
had taken. But ere he had gone far he encountered
a huge monster, half horse, half man,
which he slew after a fierce struggle.</p>

<p>At last one day he came upon a horse tied to a
linden tree, while on the ground near by lay a knight
with wounds upon him so fearful it seemed to Ecke
naught but a lightning stroke could have dealt them.
But from the dying man he learned that the lightning
had been no other than the stout arm of
Dietrich of Bern. The knight with his three
brethren had attacked Dietrich, whereby he had
been wounded unto death and the three brethren
slain. Then Ecke asked which way Dietrich had
taken, and made off with all speed to overtake him;
nor was it long ere he saw the gleam of the hero’s
great helm, called Hildegrimm, among the shades<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
of the forest. But Ecke’s armor glittered likewise,
and Dietrich becoming aware of it, he halted
and waited for Ecke to draw nigh. Then Ecke
asked:</p>

<p>“Art thou that Dietrich of Bern, the three
queens so greatly desire to look upon?”</p>

<p>And Dietrich answered: “Many are there of
that name in Bern, but an thou seekest the son
of Dittmar, of a truth thou hast indeed found
him.”</p>

<p>Then Ecke challenged him to mortal combat;
but it was scarce an hour since Dietrich had fought
with the four knights and vanquished them, so that
he was nowise desirous for a struggle with Ecke,
who in stature, moreover, was like a giant beside
him. Then Ecke sought to tempt him, saying:</p>

<p>“Seest thou this gold armor of mine? With
dragon’s blood have its links been toughened, while
this helm is the work of no less cunning hands than
Wieland’s, the mightiest smith in all Jutland. It
was wrought from a dragon’s skull. Overlaid with
gold is it, and lined with steel. They shall be
thine an thou overcomest me.”</p>

<p>But Dietrich shook his head and made answer
that his own helm and harness were good and he
asked no better. None the less did Ecke still persist,
and drawing his sword, said:</p>

<p>“Behold this wondrous blade. It was cunningly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
forged by dwarfs in the Tyrol. Twelve months
was it in the tempering, and many it hath slain,
among them the giant Grimm. From a diamond
was the fastening wrought, the hilt from a griffin’s
horn; inlaid with gold is the sheath, and the tip of
it is a ruby. Mighty is it for length and breadth,
and Sachs is its name!”</p>

<p>At last, seeing his boasting words were of no
avail, he grew angry and cried out, scornfully:
“Dietrich thou mayst call thyself, forsooth, but
never art thou Dietrich of Bern, the son of
Dittmar, the world-renowned hero whom I seek.
As for thee, before all men, aye and women likewise,
I will hold thee up to scorn as a laggard
knight!”</p>

<p>Then Dietrich warned him, saying: “Fool and
braggart! An I deign to fight with thee but one
of us shall leave this place alive!”</p>

<p>At this Ecke was overjoyed and he shouted:
“Draw thy sword, Sir Champion, and of a truth
thou shalt have need of the help of thy God!”</p>

<p>Now by this time it had grown so dark they
could distinguish each other only by the gleam of
their armor. Ecke called on God to assist Dietrich,
but for himself he invoked the aid of the devil.</p>

<p>This roused Dietrich to anger; quickly dismounting
he tied his horse to a tree and drew
his sword. Thereupon they rushed at each other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
with such fury that even the gleam of helm and
shield was no longer visible, and the air was full
of flying sparks.</p>

<p>After they had striven for a space, Dietrich said:
“Weary am I from my encounter with the four
knights. Let us rest till the morning!”</p>

<p>To this Ecke agreed, and laying himself down
forthwith, he slept while Dietrich watched beside
him. Toward midnight he roused the sleeper and
lay down in his turn. But Ecke burned to renew
the conflict, and scarce had the east begun to redden
when he awoke Dietrich with a kick, whereat
Dietrich sprang to his feet in a rage and there began
such a furious combat as would have filled a
timid spirit with terror. The earth shook beneath
the feet of the warriors, while links from their harness
flew jangling into the grass and the ground
was red with their blood. Now they fall, but rise
again and lean on their swords a space to recover
their breath; then, glaring at each other, they rush
to the attack with renewed fury.</p>

<p>As the sun rose, Ecke grasped his great sword
with both hands, and with a mighty blow clove
the lion on Dietrich’s shield and shore through
the shield itself, so that Dietrich was fain to seek
shelter in a thicket. But Ecke so hotly pressed
his yielding foe that Dietrich raised his hands on
high and besought the help of God. Then he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
smote once with all his strength and bore Ecke to
the earth. But Ecke sprang up again forthwith and
dealt Dietrich so fierce a blow that it crushed through
Hildegrimm and made a great wound on his head
beneath, while his steed, terrified by the sound,
neighed piteously.</p>

<p>Once more Dietrich called on God, but Ecke on
the devil; and now for a space each stood firm as
a rock mid thunder and lightning, while the blows
fell so fast and their blades flashed so swiftly in
air, it seemed as there were a dozen swords aloft at
once. Foaming with rage, Ecke reviled Dietrich
and swore the devil must be helping him; but
Dietrich shouted:</p>

<p>“God alone is my aid!” and again hurled Ecke
to the ground. A second time he rose and again
the fight began. At length, when the sun was far
above the mountain tops, Ecke fell for the third
time; whereupon Dietrich sprang upon him, tore
off his helm and bade him yield. But Ecke, putting
forth all his strength, gripped Dietrich with
such force that the blood spurted from his wounds.
Long and fiercely they strove together upon the
ground, till at last Dietrich plunged his sword
through a cleft in Ecke’s corselet and into the
heart of his fierce foe.</p>

<p>Dietrich looked with awe and even with pity upon
the dead form of the gigantic warrior. Seizing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
a fallen tree, he pried a great rock from the
earth and made a grave. In this he laid the body
and covered it with earth; then kneeling down he
thanked God for his victory and prayed for the lost
soul. The carbuncle from Ecke’s helm he set in
his own cloven Hildegrimm. Then he took the
sword Sachs, mounted his horse, and rode back to
his own land to bide there till his wounds should
be healed. And from that day he bore no other
sword than that which he had so hardly won from
Ecke in their terrible fight,—the wonderful great
Sachs.</p>

<p><span class="drop-cap">M</span>ANY tales like these did Siegfried hear,
of heroes, both of his own and bygone
times, till he could no longer restrain
his longing to go out into the world in
quest of adventure. And all the more urgent was
this longing, since even now, at the age of eighteen,
there was not a champion in all his father’s kingdom
that could equal him in the use of sword and spear.
So at last he took leave of his parents; nor did
they, dear as was their only son to them, deem it
otherwise than meet that he should go forth to win
a hero’s renown. Therefore they invoked God’s
blessing on him and prayed that he might return to
them rich in honor and wisdom, so as to govern
well the kingdom when it should fall to him, and
be a shining example to his warriors, the champion
of the oppressed, and the scourge of evil-doers.</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">So fared the young knight forth; to him</div>
<div class="indent">The world seemed bathed in light;</div>
<div class="verse">A hero’s glory he would win—</div>
<div class="indent">Or perish in the fight.</div>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>Now Siegfried had heard much of the fame of
Mime, the great smith, him who had been for three
years the master of Wieland, the slayer of Amilias.
Thither accordingly he first betook himself, that he
might learn to forge weapons. But Mime had
workmen, great brawny fellows, who were evil-disposed
toward Siegfried and tried to pick a quarrel
with him. Soon they came to blows, but Siegfried
felled them all, and the strongest one—called Eckenbrecht—he
dragged from the forge by his hair.
When Mime saw what he had done he was amazed
at the giant strength of this youth. He set him to
work forthwith and Siegfried, still furious with rage,
dealt such mighty blows on the anvil that it burst
asunder and was driven into the ground, while iron
bar, hammer, and tongs went flying all about the
forge.</p>

<p>Here Siegfried abode for many weeks, roaming
far and wide through the depths of the forest to
chase the deer or capture wild beasts for pastime,
leaving them hanging upon the trees. Now Mime,
the smith, had a brother, Regin, who, by some
wicked enchantment, had been changed into a
dragon, and went about slaying and devouring both
man and beast. Him Mime sought one day, and said:</p>

<p>“It is in my mind, brother, to send thee the
fairest and mightiest youth in all the land that thou
mayst devour him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>Then he went home and bade Siegfried go into
the forest to burn some charcoal. This he did, and
when he had reached the place whereto Mime had
directed him, he felled some trees and built a great
fire. Thereupon he slew a boar, ripped off the
bristly hide, and was about to roast it before the
fire, when of a sudden out from the shadows of
the forest sprang a dragon, terrible to behold. Its
jaws were so huge that it could have swallowed a
horse and rider; fiery sparks shot from its eyes, and
steam issued from its nostrils. But Siegfried did
not shrink, for he knew not fear. Having no
sword, he quickly snatched from the fire a stout
sapling and thrust the blazing end between the jaws
of the dragon, at the same time smiting its scaly
head with such force that the monster’s skull was
shattered, and blood and bone flew to the tree-tops.
The huge reptile rolled upon the ground lashing its
tail and striking such terrible blows therewith that
the earth trembled and great trees were shaken.
Siegfried stood afar till the struggle was over and
the monster lay dead; whereupon he struck off the
head with his axe and cut out the heart, which he
roasted before the fire. Now, it chanced that as
the blood dripped therefrom, he dipped his finger
in to taste it, but no sooner had he touched his lips
with it, than lo! straightway he understood the language
of the birds. And this is what they sang:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“Thou wast meant the worm to feed;</div>
<div class="verse">Mime is thy foe. Take heed!”</div>
</div></div>

<p>Next, Siegfried sought and found the den of the
monster, deep in a cleft of rock; and there lay a
she-dragon with her young. He flung a tree across,
that they might not escape; then he felled more
trees, and casting them into the cleft, set fire to
them. When the reptiles were consumed there
gushed forth from the rock a clear white stream; it
was the fat of the dragons. And Siegfried, taking
off his garments, smeared his body therewith, all
save one spot between the shoulders whereon a
linden leaf had chanced to fall. Wherever the
dragon’s fat touched it the skin seemed to grow
more fair and smooth, whereas in truth it had become
as impenetrable as the toughest hide. Thereupon
Siegfried clothed himself once more and set
out on his homeward way, bearing the head of the
dragon upon his shoulders; but when Mime’s
workmen saw him returning, they fled in terror, for
they had believed him dead.</p>

<p>Now it chanced that Mime saw none of this for
he was at work in the forge, and when Siegfried of a
sudden stood in the doorway and cast the dragon’s
head at his feet he was alarmed and changed color;
yet he feigned to be greatly rejoiced over Siegfried’s
victory and therewith bestowed on him as reward a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
costly suit of armor which he had wrought for King
Hernit.</p>

<p>Siegfried spoke no word while Mime enveloped
him in the armor and girded on the great sword
Gram, nor yet when the smith proffered him likewise
Grane, the noblest steed in all the world.
When Mime had finished, Siegfried upbraided him
for his treachery and falseness. Mime denied it
fiercely, whereupon the hero drew his sword and
struck his head from his shoulders. Then he went
to the pasture to seek the horse Grane. No man
had ever dared ride this wondrous steed; but when
Siegfried approached, it sprang toward him, neighing
joyously, as if to greet at last a worthy master.
Whereupon Siegfried mounted and rode away.</p>

<p><span class="drop-cap">F</span>ORTH into the great world the young hero
fared at last; and one day he chanced to
meet with Dietrich of Bern, the same who
had vanquished the mighty Ecke, and
many valiant deeds thereafter wrought. Against
him Siegfried had long yearned to try his strength,
wherefore he hailed the champion joyfully and offered
him combat; nor was Dietrich averse to this.
Long they strove, but no advantage could either
gain; whereupon they agreed to a truce, and Dietrich
took Siegfried with him to the court of King
Etzel. There he abode three years, fighting in
many battles for the King and performing such
heroic feats that his fame soon spread throughout
the land. Then came peace, and his sword being
no longer of use, he once more rode upon his way.
Through many lands he had wandered, when he
came one day to a hill whereon stood a great castle,
and near by on the plain was a city.</p>

<p>Now at this time there was great strife within the
castle, for the King was dead, and his two sons,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
Nibelung and Schilbung, were left to share their
father’s treasure, and each believed the other was
seeking to overreach him.</p>

<p>When they learned that Siegfried the famous
hero was come, they were overjoyed, and resolved
forthwith that he should divide the treasure for
them. This Siegfried agreed to, if they would
swear to abide by his judgment, and they took an
oath so to do, bestowing on him besides the sword
Balmung, which was even greater and sharper than
his own Gram. Then he set to work and divided
the treasure as was just and lawful. But still the
King’s sons were not content, and notwithstanding
their oath the quarrel broke out afresh. Siegfried
would have made peace between them once again,
but mad with rage and hatred they turned upon
him, and at once a terrible fight began. Siegfried
had but a handful of followers, while opposed to
them were many hundreds, with twelve gigantic
warriors at the head; yet soon the ground was
strewn with heaps of their slain. So swift and true
fell the lightning strokes of Balmung that men were
mowed down like grass beneath the sickle. At last
the King’s two sons were slain; whereupon those
who were left alive yielded themselves and hailed
Siegfried as their lord.</p>

<p>Thus did Siegfried become King of the land of
the Nibelungs (Norway) but another hard struggle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
must he undergo, for anon came Alberich, the
powerful dwarf who guarded the King’s treasure, to
avenge the death of Nibelung and Schilbung. This
Alberich was but of the stature of a child, yet was
he finely formed and magnificently arrayed. For a
weapon he carried a whip of seven thongs, each
tipped with a golden knob, with which he dealt
such fearful blows that no shield or helm, however
strong, might withstand them. Well might Siegfried
dread to meet so formidable a foe; yet he knew
no fear, and no sooner did the dwarf draw nigh than
they sprang at each other like two eagles. But lo!
of a sudden Alberich vanished before Siegfried’s
eyes and his spear smote the rocky wall with such
force that it broke, sending a great stone crashing to
the ground, while at the same instant he received a
blow that burst three of the steel rings of his armor.
The dwarf had drawn from his pocket and donned
the Tarnkappe, or magic cap, that made its wearer
invisible.</p>

<p>Siegfried laid about him furiously with Balmung,
but Alberich only laughed mockingly; for not once
did the great sword touch him, while Siegfried
received many a blow that might well have slain a
giant. Seeing that if he did not prevent this he
must in the end be overcome, he thrust Balmung
into the sheath, turned quick as thought and, seizing
the dwarf with his hands, succeeded at last, in spite<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
of his struggles, in snatching the magic cap from
him. This cap had likewise the power of lending
its wearer the strength of twelve men. Moreover,
Alberich was now once more visible, wherefore
Siegfried again drew his sword and rushed upon his
foe. A mighty blow from the whip dashed his
shield to pieces, but he soon overpowered the
dwarf, who now begged for mercy, and swore
allegiance to his conqueror. Thereupon Siegfried
granted him his life and bade him continue as
guardian of the treasure.</p>

<p>Now, this treasure was a hoard of gold and jewels
so vast that a hundred wagons could not have borne
it away, nor did it ever grow less, however much
might be taken therefrom. With it, moreover, was
a magic wand of gold that gave its owner power
over all men.</p>

<p>Siegfried did not tarry in his new-found kingdom.
When Alberich and all the chief Nibelungs had
sworn fealty to him as their liege lord, he bade
them farewell and rode homeward to Santen.</p>

<p>There reigned in Burgundy at this time a mighty
prince named Günther, who had two brothers,
Gernot and Giselher, no less wise in council and
brave in battle than himself. Now, these three
princes had a sister, a noble damsel as beautiful as
the day, and her name was Kriemhild.</p>

<p>One night it chanced that Kriemhild had a strange<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
dream. Her favorite falcon rose from her hand
and soared aloft, whereupon two gray eagles swooped
down from the mountain top and struck their sharp
talons into its breast, so that it fell dead at her feet.
Full of trouble, she awoke and related the dream to
her mother, who said: “May God have thee in His
care! The falcon, meseemeth, is the gallant knight
whom one day thou shalt wed.”</p>

<p>But shamed, the maiden answered: “Never shall
I be wife to any man!”</p>

<p>Thereupon her mother reproved her, saying:
“Make no rash vows, my daughter! No greater
honor can fall to the lot of any maiden than to be
true wife to a noble lord.”</p>

home with his parents, but such were
the tales that reached him of the wondrous
beauty and grace of Kriemhild
that he determined to go to Burgundy and woo
her for his wife. His father warned him that the
Burgundians were insolent and haughty, and bade
him be on his guard against King Günther and
his brethren, and most of all to beware of the
fierce Hagen of Tronege (Treves), a near kinsman
of the King. Whereupon Siegfried boldly declared
he feared no man, neither the princes nor their
kinsman, and would gladly meet them in combat,
one or all. When Siegmund saw that his son’s
resolve was not to be shaken, he wished to send a
thousand knights to accompany him, but this Siegfried
refused, nor would he have more than twelve
stout warriors, and those of his own choice.</p>

<p>But Siegfried’s words at length prevailed over his

with a heavy heart. Soon all was ready, and Siegfried,
with his trusty followers, well armed and
equipped, bade a loving farewell to all and set forth
upon his journey, followed by many tears and
prayers.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">The trappings of their prancing steeds</div>
<div class="indent">With ruddy gold did shine,</div>
<div class="verse">As Siegfried and his gallant knights</div>

<div class="indent">Was never martial band,</div>
<div class="verse">As they their stately progress made</div>
<div class="indent">Into King Günther’s land.</div>
</div></div>

<p>On the seventh day they came to Worms, where
never before had such mighty heroes been seen.
The people in the streets stood and stared to see
them pass, and many ran after them; but Siegfried
far surpassed them all in beauty and stature no less
than in the splendor of his equipment. Before the
King’s castle they halted, whereupon serving-men<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
hastened to assist the strangers to dismount, and
provide for their steeds. But Siegfried said:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Let bide the steeds belonging to</div>
<div class="indent">Myself and my brave men!</div>
<div class="verse">It may be we depart anon</div>

<div class="verse">To him who knows and will reply,</div>
<div class="indent">In truth will I be bound,</div>
<div class="verse">If he will say where now perchance</div>
<div class="indent">King Günther may be found.</div>
</div></div>

<p>To this they replied that the King was in the great
hall of the castle, and pointed thither. Meanwhile
Günther had perceived the well-armed stranger
knights from the window, and, greatly wondering
thereat, questioned his brothers concerning them;
but none could say who they might be. Then out-spoke
one of his men:</p>

<p>“My Lord, were it not well to summon Hagen?
He hath seen many lands, and perchance will have
knowledge of these strangers.”</p>

<p>When Hagen came he said: “Never before,
forsooth, have I laid eyes on yon bold heroes; yet
much have I heard of Siegfried, and it may well be
he that towers above the rest.”</p>

<p>And Günther replied:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“Meseemeth thou art right.</div>
<div class="indent">Yon dauntless chief of princely air</div>
<div class="verse">Is he, that valiant knight!</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
<div class="indent">That he is bold and high of mind</div>
<div class="verse">I long have understood,</div>
<div class="indent">Let us go forth to greet our guest—</div>
<div class="verse">Now is his coming good!”</div>
</div></div>

<p>Though there was none in all Günther’s court
so haughty as Hagen, yet he did not gainsay this.
And the King went out to welcome Siegfried, whereupon
that hero challenged him forthwith to mortal
combat, whosoever should be the victor to fall heir
to the crown and lands of the vanquished. But
Hagen feared for the issue of this; wherefore he
spoke soft words to Siegfried, greeting him as friend,
not foe, and conducted him to the castle hall, where he
drank of the King’s wine and was made welcome.</p>

<p>Thus did Siegfried become an honored guest at
Günther’s court, and long he bided there, beguiling
the time with tilting, casting the javelin, stone-throwing,
and all manner of knightly sports; nor
was there any that could surpass him in feats of skill
and daring. But he saw naught of Kriemhild the
fair, though her glances many a time fell upon him:</p>

<small><i>Siegfried makes War against the Saxons</i></small></h2>
</div>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/dropcap-n.jpg" width="78" height="75" alt="N">
</div>

<p><span class="drop-cap">N</span>OW, it came to pass that one day messengers
arrived from two powerful Kings,
Lendeger of the Saxon land and Lendegast
of Denmark, declaring war against
Günther, whose dominions they were preparing to
lay waste. Thereupon was the King greatly troubled,
for the enemy far outnumbered his own men and,
moreover, were well armed. He took counsel of
Hagen, who bade him secure the aid of Siegfried
without delay. But Siegfried had already observed
Günther’s sorrowful mien, and asked him what lay
so heavy on his heart. The King disclosed the
cause of his trouble, whereupon Siegfried swore to
aid him with all his power, and joyfully hastened
to summon his twelve knights to join the thousand
Burgundians Günther had assembled, while Hagen,
with all his followers, made ready to march with
them.</p>

<p>The messengers were released and sent upon their
way; but when it was made known to the two Kings
that Siegfried was with the Burgundians, gathering<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
together an army to meet them, they hastily doubled
the number of their forces.</p>

<p>Soon thereafter the two hostile armies drew near
to each other, and Siegfried rode on before to the
top of a hill to learn somewhat of the enemy’s
strength. Of Danes and Saxons there were full
thrice his own number of men, but little did this
dismay his bold spirit. Now, while he gazed, there
rode forth from the opposite camp King Lendeger,
who likewise thought to spy upon his foes. Swift
as a whirlwind they rushed to the attack, and casting
aside their shattered spears, sprang from their
horses. Thick and fast fell the blows of their
swords on shield and helm, but soon the Saxon
King was sorely hurt and knelt at Siegfried’s feet,
craving his mercy and yielding himself captive.</p>

<p>Then came thirty of the Saxon knights, who,
having observed the combat from afar, dashed to
the rescue of their lord; but these also Siegfried
overcame after a desperate fight,—all save one,
who fled, bearing the evil tidings to his comrades.
Thereupon Siegfried rode back with his prisoners
and summoned his army to the attack. Pennons
waved, shield and armor glittered in the sunlight,
while clouds of dust arose, as, shouting their
battle-cries, they rushed upon the foe. Then followed
such a battle as rarely had been known before,
so fiercely and bravely was it fought. Many<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
a shining helm was dulled, and many a lance splintered,
while far and wide the plain was strewn with
broken shields and swords. But none could stand
before Siegfried. Thrice he broke through the enemy’s
ranks, hewing bloody gaps wheresoever he
rode, and at last he came upon King Lendegast.
The sight of Siegfried gave fresh courage to the
Danish King, for he burned to avenge his brother.
Furiously they sprang at one another, but the first
stroke of Balmung shattered the golden shield of
Lendegast, while the second clove his armor and bore
him to the ground; whereupon he yielded himself
likewise, and ordering his banners lowered, sued for
peace. The greater part of the Danes and Saxons
fled, but there fell into the hands of the victors full
five hundred warriors, together with the two Kings,
wherewith they joyfully set out on their homeward
way.</p>

<p>Now, Siegfried had despatched messengers to
bear news of the victory to King Günther; and
one of these, being perchance aware that Kriemhild
looked not unkindly on the young hero, betook
himself straightway to her.</p>

<p>“If thou dost bring me good tidings,” cried
Kriemhild, “thou shalt have all my gold!”</p>

<p>“In truth, fair lady,” replied the messenger,
“none hath fought so nobly as my lord Siegfried,
nor lives there a hero with fame to equal his!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>Thereupon he told her of the battle, and how
Siegfried had vanquished the two Kings and was
bringing them captives to the court of Burgundy.
At this the maiden’s eyes shone like stars, and
when the messenger departed she bestowed on him
not only the promised gold, but also a suit of rich
apparel. And thereafter she stood often at her
window, gazing toward the road by which the warriors
must return.</p>

  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/dropcap-a.jpg" width="80" height="75" alt="A">
</div>

<p><span class="drop-cap2">A</span>T last Siegfried drew near with his victorious
band, and right royally was he
welcomed, for in truth he had saved
the kingdom. They came laden with
spoils of war, and with many a shattered helm,
and cloven shield, and many a blood-stained saddle.
The royal captives flung themselves on Günther’s
mercy, but he could not have received them more
kindly had they been honored guests instead of
conquered foes.</p>

<p>Now, it was in the King’s mind to celebrate the
victory by a great festival, but his brother Gernot
counselled him to delay yet awhile, till the wounds
of the prisoners should be healed, so the time was
fixed for six weeks thence. So Siegfried took his
leave for that space and rode back to Santen, for
he greatly longed to see his parents.</p>

<p>At last the six weeks were past and the festival
was held with great splendor and rejoicing. The
King, as a surprise to Siegfried, whose attachment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
for Kriemhild was well known to him, had bidden
the ladies of the court to grace the festival with
their presence. Accordingly, when the lords and
knights had all assembled, making a glittering array
of shining armor and gorgeous apparel, the train of
damsels entered the hall; whereupon there arose a
great pushing and crowding, so desirous were all to
behold the beautiful Kriemhild. At last she came,
walking at her mother’s side and followed by richly
dressed and bejewelled damsels and a hundred chosen
knights. When Siegfried’s eyes fell upon her it was
as if the light of morning had broken through the
clouds.</p>

<div class="verse">Full many a gem on her attire</div>

<div class="indent">He must admit, I ween,</div>
<div class="verse">That on the earth there never yet</div>

<div class="indent">The best of womankind!</div>
<div class="verse">Such beauteous vision well might raise</div>
<div class="indent">Each hero’s heart and mind.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>Then Gernot said to the King: “Never yet
hath our sister Kriemhild paid greeting to a hero.
Methinks it were well she should now welcome
Siegfried, for such an honor perchance may bind
him to us henceforth.”</p>

<p>These words pleased Günther, and he forthwith
sent a message to Siegfried, bidding him approach
and receive his sister’s thanks. Now, when Kriemhild
saw the splendid young hero standing before
her, her cheeks grew red as the dawn, but with a
gracious gesture she gave him her hand and said:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“Thrice welcome, my lord Siegfried!</div>
<div class="indent">Thy praises wide resound,</div>
<div class="verse">For by thy might were victory</div>

<div class="verse">Brave heroes do thee honor;</div>

<div class="indent">And aided by thy deed;</div>
<div class="verse">Now may our country’s warmest thanks</div>
<div class="indent">And blessings be thy meed!”</div>
</div></div>

<p>They looked into each other’s eyes, and therewith
a great love sprang up in their hearts, and
they knew that never henceforth could they live
apart. Then indeed Siegfried’s heart beat high
with joy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">In Summer and that blithest time,</div>

</div></div>

<p>And now began the great tournament, wherein
the conquered Kings and their knights took part,
being quite healed of their wounds; and for twelve
days the whole court was given over to feasting and
rejoicing.</p>

<p>When all was over, Lendeger and Lendegast
came before King Günther, and besought him for
their freedom, offering for ransom as much gold as
might be borne by five hundred horses. Günther
declared this was the due of Siegfried who had vanquished
them. But Siegfried cared naught for the
gold, and said:</p>

<p>“Let them go hence in peace, so they will pledge
themselves nevermore to make war upon thee!”</p>

<p>So Günther bound the two Kings by this pledge,
in token whereof they gave him their hands. Then
he sent them with all their followers back to their
own land, laden with gifts.</p>

<small><i>King Günther’s Voyage to Iceland</i></small></h2>
</div>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/dropcap-a.jpg" width="80" height="75" alt="A">
</div>

<p><span class="drop-cap2">A</span>T this time wondrous tales were brought
to Worms of a beauteous and warlike
princess who dwelt in Iceland and was
called Brunhild. Many knights had
sought her hand, but she chose to remain unwedded.
At last, to rid her of those that grew too
bold, she set a task for him who would be her lord.
In a trial of skill must he meet her, three knightly
feats to perform, and win them all ere she would
wed, but should he fail in a single one his head
must pay the forfeit.</p>

<p>Now, such was her skill in casting the javelin
that no knight in all the land could vie with her,
while a ponderous stone she could hurl as it were a
ball in her hands, and bound after it so quickly as
to overtake it ere it fell. Wherefore there was none
but lost in the test and therewith his head. Thus
did Brunhild think to free herself from wooers,
yet still were many bold knights drawn thither by
the fame of her beauty, only to perish thereby.</p>

<p>When King Günther heard all this, great was his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
desire to win the beautiful warrior-maiden for his
wife, and he determined forthwith to try his fortune.
Vainly did Siegfried seek to dissuade him,
warning him of Brunhild’s marvellous strength, but
Günther was firm. Moreover, by Hagen’s counsel
he urged Siegfried to go with him, and aid him in
his venture; nor was Siegfried averse to sharing the
danger; but first he drew a promise from Günther
that should his wooing be successful he would grant
him in return the hand of his sister Kriemhild.
Thereupon all was made ready for the voyage.
Günther would fain have taken with him thirty
thousand of his stoutest warriors, but Siegfried
warned him that force would avail him little against
the stalwart Icelanders. Only in knightly fashion
might Brunhild be won. So none went with them
save Hagen and his brother Dankwart.</p>

<p>Then Günther and Siegfried betook themselves
to Kriemhild, and made known their desire for
rich court dresses for themselves and their companions.
Kriemhild besought them not to undertake
so dangerous a venture, for in her heart was a
foreboding of evil; but when she saw it was of no
avail she promised them the garments. In seven
weeks she, with thirty of her women, prepared
four splendid suits of silk and other rich stuffs
adorned with costly furs and precious stones.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, a ship had been laden with ample<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
store of viands and good Rhenish wine, and in this
the four gallant knights now embarked with their
steeds and armor. The sail was spread, the oars
unlocked, and presently a fresh breeze bore them
gayly down the Rhine and out into the open sea.
But Kriemhild sat at her window watching, till at
last they passed from sight and all the world was
blotted out by her tears.</p>

<p>Siegfried was the helmsman. On the twelfth day
Iceland loomed before them, its lofty towers rising
boldly from the mirror-like surface of the water.
Now a sudden fancy seized Siegfried, and he told
his comrades that not as a king’s son would he appear
in Iceland, but as vassal to King Günther.</p>

<p>As the ship drew near the mighty castle of Isenstein
they saw that the windows were filled with fair damsels;
whereupon Siegfried asked the King which of
them seemed to him the most beautiful. Günther
pointed out the tallest, a stately maiden clad all in purest
white, who, Siegfried declared, was no other than
Brunhild herself. But anon they all vanished from the
windows and hastened to adorn themselves, that they
might welcome the knights as was their due. Siegfried,
in his part of vassal, led forth from the ship a
horse bridled with gold, and held the stirrup for
King Günther to mount, and thereafter fetched his
own horse and followed. The King’s steed and
his rider were magnificently decked with gold and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
jewels, while behind rode Hagen and his brother
Dankwart, clad all in sable and mounted on coal-black
horses.</p>

<p>Eighty-six turrets rose above the outer wall of
the castle; and within the gates, which stood wide
open, could be seen three palaces and a vast hall,
built all of green marble. As they rode into the
courtyard Brunhild’s retainers met them and demanded
their weapons; whereat Hagen frowned,
nor would he yield up his till Siegfried, who had
aforetime been Brunhild’s guest, admonished him
that such was the custom at her court. Yet was it
with bad grace that he obeyed. Meanwhile Brunhild
had questioned her followers concerning the
strangers; whereupon one said:</p>

<p>“For myself, lady, I know them not. Yet hath
yonder stalwart knight a look of Siegfried; the
other would seem a king, methinks; the third
frowns darkly, as he were of a sullen humor; while
the fourth is but a youth, yet frank and courteous
withal.”</p>

<p>Then Brunhild descended the broad stairs to
greet the knights, and following her came a train of
a hundred damsels most fair to see, and five hundred
knights bearing swords in their hands.</p>

<p>But Siegfried pointed to Günther and replied:
“Yonder stands the King of Burgundy, fair Queen,
who comes to seek thy hand: as for me, I am but
his vassal.”</p>

<p>Then Günther stepped forward to urge his suit
before the Queen, but no reply would she vouchsafe,
save to warn him that he must submit to the
trial. Then Siegfried whispered to the King to be
of good heart and rely on his aid; but Hagen
became furious and defiantly offered to do battle
with the Queen on behalf of his lord. Thereupon
Brunhild threatened them all with death should the
King not prevail; but finding that even this failed
to shake their purpose, she commanded that the
trial take place without delay. When they had
come to the spot she donned a golden coat of mail
and over this a silken tabard, edged with costly
lace. Seven hundred knights then stepped forth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
and formed a circle about them: these were to be
the judges of the contest.</p>

<p>Brunhild called for her weapons, whereupon there
came four men bearing a golden shield, studded with
steel and thickly set with gems even to the strap
thereof. This they held while Brunhild, pushing
up her sleeve, placed it on her arm, swinging it
aloft as though it were but a shadow. Next came
the javelin borne by three men. It was huge and
heavy and tipped with a keen blade of steel. When
Hagen saw the ease with which Brunhild wielded
these mighty weapons, he was awed by her well-nigh
superhuman strength, and for the first time in his
life, fear crept into his heart.</p>

<p>“Would we had never left the Rhine,” he thought,
“for here shall we surely meet our death!”</p>

<p>And to Dankwart he said: “Were it the
devil himself, methinks he must succumb to
this woman!”</p>

<p>Even Günther felt his courage sink, while Dankwart,
overcome with grief for his lord, whose life he
held for lost, exclaimed: “Now, had we but our
arms, brother Hagen, with my own hand would I
strike down that beauteous she-devil, ere I would
see my dear lord slain!”</p>

<p>But Brunhild overheard these words; whereat
she looked around with a scornful smile upon her
lips, and gave orders that the arms of the two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
knights should be restored to them. And when
Dankwart felt his sword within his grasp once
more his face flushed with joy. Now the contest
was about to begin, and Günther, well-nigh
despairing, stood over against his beauteous adversary
when of a sudden he heard a voice in his
ear. He could see no one, but the voice said:</p>

<p>“It is I, Siegfried. Have no fear!”</p>

<p>Unobserved, the hero had hastened to the ship
and put on the magic cap, which not only made
him invisible but gave him the strength of twelve
men.</p>

<p>“Do thou make a show of performing the
feats,” he whispered to the King, “while I will
bear the shield and cast the javelin.”</p>

<p>At these words Günther’s spirits rose. Now the
signal was given and Brunhild hurled her spear.
Fire flew from the King’s shield as the spear drove
clean through it, striking sparks from the mail beneath,
and bearing both heroes to the earth. Blood
poured from Siegfried’s mouth but they quickly
sprang to their feet again, and now was it Siegfried’s
turn to cast the javelin, albeit Günther seemed to
make the throw. Siegfried had turned the spear
about lest the sharp point should wound the Queen.
Away it sped, whizzing through the air, and struck
her shield with such force that it rang again. Down
fell Brunhild, but she rose undaunted and smilingly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
praised Günther for his throw, for still was she confident
the victory would be hers. Then she called
for the stone, whereupon was brought a round stone
so huge and massive that twelve men could scarce
raise it from the ground. This she lifted, poised
a moment, and then flung from her with so powerful
an arm that it flew twelve fathoms length; nor
was this amazing feat all, for with a mighty bound
she sprang after the stone, overleaping it ere it
touched the ground. Again Günther lost heart,
but when it came to his turn, Siegfried not only
cast the stone far beyond Brunhild’s mark, but,
taking Günther with him, he bounded so quickly
after it that he caught it again before it fell.</p>

<p>Brunhild grew red with wrath, but was forced to
own herself vanquished; wherefore turning to her
courtiers, and with a gesture of the hand toward
Günther, she said:</p>

<p>“Now are ye henceforth true lieges to King
Günther, one and all!”</p>

<p>Then came all the chiefs to lay their arms at the
feet of the King; and after he had saluted Brunhild
with courtly words, she bade him repair with her to
the marble palace, while Hagen and Dankwart followed
to share in the honors of their lord.</p>

<p>But Siegfried had made all speed to the ship to
lay aside the cap and now returning, sought the
Queen and asked her if the contest would not soon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
begin. Brunhild confessed that she had lost the
wager; whereupon Siegfried said:</p>

<p>“Right joyful news is this, fair Queen! Now
of a truth must thou fare with us to the Rhine!”</p>

<p>To this Brunhild made no reply, but she forthwith
summoned all her kinsmen and followers to
the castle. Then from all quarters there began
to assemble so vast a number of knights and warriors
that Hagen grew uneasy, and said:</p>

<p>“Methinks this bodeth us no good. Albeit Brunhild’s
court hath sworn fealty to our King, yet may
her people look upon him as a foe and evil befall
us thereby.”</p>

<p>“Thy words are wise,” replied Siegfried. “Now
will I go hence and summon to our aid such warriors
as never yet hast thou beholden. A thousand
mighty champions will I fetch hither; but should
any mark my absence, do thou, King Günther, say
that thou hast despatched me hence.”</p>

<p>And thereto the King gladly agreed, but bade
him return as speedily as might be.</p>

<p><span class="drop-cap">H</span>ASTENING to the ship, Siegfried once
more donned the cap and put out to
sea. The ship seemed to be moving of
itself, for Siegfried was invisible, but urged
on by his strong arm and a favoring wind that
filled the sails, it sped along so fast that the end
of a day and night found him an hundred miles
from Iceland. On the second day he came to the
shores of the land of the Nibelungs, which he had
once conquered and made subject to him. Before
the King’s castle he landed, and wishing to discover
first of all if the treasure was well guarded, knocked
at the gate. The porter, who was a giant, asked:</p>

<p>“Who knocks?”</p>

<p>And Siegfried, disguising his voice, replied:
“One who would fain exchange blows with thee!”</p>

<hr class="tiny">

</figure>
<hr class="tiny">

<p>Thereupon the giant, seizing his iron staff,
rushed forth and attacked Siegfried, who defended
himself stoutly, till a mighty blow split his shield
Goldrand. Then was he in great peril, yet it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
pleased him well to find such zeal in his service.
At last Siegfried smote the giant so that he stumbled
and fell; whereupon he quickly seized and
bound him.</p>

<p>The clash of arms, however, had reached the ears
of Alberich the dwarf, who was guardian of the
treasure; and now, clad in helm and shirt of mail,
his terrible whip in hand, he sprang upon Siegfried.
Thereupon Siegfried grasped him by his long gray
beard and soon overpowered him. Then Alberich
besought him to spare his life, saying:</p>

<p>“I would gladly own thee master, but I have
already sworn faith to another—the mighty Siegfried.”</p>

<p>At this Siegfried made himself known, and releasing
the dwarf, said: “In sooth, good Alberich,
I did but try thee, to prove thy faith.”</p>

<p>Overjoyed, the dwarf cried: “Now is it indeed
meet that such a master should be lord of all the
land!”</p>

<p>The giant was set free and well praised for his
valor; and thereafter Siegfried bade the dwarf
awaken the Nibelungs, for that he had need of a
thousand men. Alberich obeyed; and when they
heard that Siegfried was come again, they sprang up
joyfully and hastened to the lighted hall to greet
him. By the next day full thirty thousand had
assembled, but of these Siegfried chose but a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
thousand of the strongest and bravest, and with
them sailed away.</p>

<p>Oft, meantime, did Günther watch anxiously
across the sea, when one day, having mounted with
Brunhild and all her court to the battlements of
the castle, he saw the ships of Siegfried and his
Nibelungs approaching. Marvelling greatly, Brunhild
asked who might be these strangers whose sails
gleamed so white, and whose armor shone so dazzlingly
in the sunlight; and Günther answered
joyously:</p>

<p>“Now, forsooth, are these my own bold warriors,
come to fetch me home!”</p>

<p>Soon Siegfried strode to shore with the Nibelungs
and the Queen gave them gracious welcome.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The King was eager to depart, nor did Brunhild
gainsay him, but leaving her uncle to rule over Iceland
in her stead, she took leave of her people and
sailed away with Günther to Burgundy.</p>

land, Siegfried rode on before to proclaim
the glad tidings, for much he
craved sight of Kriemhild, nor was the
maiden’s joy less when she again beheld the gallant
hero for whose fate she so long had trembled. As a
token of her happiness at his safe return she gave him
four-and-twenty golden armlets, set with precious
stones, to be divided among his bravest followers.</p>

<p>There was great stir in Worms to prepare for the
home-coming of Günther and his bride. The spacious
hall was magnificently decorated and set with
long tables and benches, for all the lords and knights
of the realm were bidden to the feast, while the whole
court made ready to go forth to meet the returning
company. At the head of the long train rode
Kriemhild with her mother, mounted on noble
steeds; and after them a hundred ladies of the
court, all on white palfreys, richly caparisoned, their
bridles gleaming with gold. Each horse was led by
a man-at-arms, bearing lance and shield, while the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
robes of Kriemhild and her women sparkled with
gold and jewels. Behind them rode a troop of
armed knights. Soon the two trains met, and joyous
greetings followed.</p>

<p>Gladly the knights beheld the greetings of the two
princesses, and much debate was there as to which
was the fairer; but those best versed in womanly
beauty declared themselves in favor of Kriemhild.</p>

<p>Forthwith was a tournament held in honor of the
bride, the Burgundians on one side, Siegfried with
his Nibelungs on the other; whereby there arose
such clouds of dust it seemed the whole earth were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
burning, while showers of sparks flew from shield
and harness. Silken tents had been raised meanwhile,
and thither the noble ladies repaired with the
King and his kinsmen and Siegfried, to refresh themselves
with a repast, after which the whole company
set out for Worms. Along the road as they passed
were bands of stout yeomen wrestling or wielding
their staves, and Siegfried offered prizes for the most
skilful and daring. At last they reached the city
and, greeted by strains of music and waving banners,
rode into the ancient castle of the King.</p>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/dropcap-n.jpg" width="78" height="75" alt="N">
</div>

<p><span class="drop-cap">N</span>OT long thereafter did Siegfried claim
his promise from the king, saying:
“Thou hast sworn, so I did aid thee in
thy wooing, thy sister Kriemhild should
be my wife!”</p>

<p>“Nor will I break my oath!” replied Günther,
and straightway sought his sister. When Kriemhild
learned that she was to be wedded to Siegfried, she
made no demur, but joyfully gave her hand to the
young hero who so long had held her heart.</p>

<p>That night there was a great feast in the castle
hall and Siegfried with his fair betrothed sat opposite
to Günther and his bride, whereat Brunhild wondered
greatly. Much it grieved her that the sister
of her lord should be given in marriage to a vassal,
for as such had Siegfried appeared in Iceland, and
presently she began to reproach the King therefor,
tears falling from her beautiful eyes. This alarmed
Günther, and he sought to soothe her, saying that
Siegfried was no vassal, but a great prince like himself,
with lands and subjects. Thereupon Brunhild
demanded wherefore Siegfried had chosen to appear<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
at her court as Günther’s liegeman; but this the
King refused to make known to her until some future
day, nor would he yield, though more and more she
urged him, being now full of curiosity to learn the
secret. At last she could bear it no longer, but
springing angrily from her seat she left the hall and
retired to her own chamber. Thither Günther followed,
thinking to appease her and found her in a
storm of tears and rage. Again she besought him
to tell her the truth, and again he refused, whereupon
her fury knew no bounds. Seizing her offending
lord, she bound him hand and foot and tied him
to an iron hook on the wall, and there, despite all his
entreaties, was he forced to stay till the morning.
Meanwhile Brunhild slumbered peacefully; but
when at daylight the steps of the servitors were
heard in the passage without, she loosed him, lest he
be brought to shame before them.</p>

<p>As the midday hour approached, the royal
couples, attired in all the splendor of their robes of
state, repaired to the cathedral, where after holy
mass was sung, the coronation took place amid great
pomp and rejoicing. Six hundred noble squires were
knighted in honor of the day and a grand tournament
followed, wherein they had full scope to prove
their skill and valor. All were joyous save the King.
Perceiving his gloomy and troubled look, Siegfried
took him aside and asked the cause of his sadness,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
and Günther told how he had spent the night in his
wife’s chamber. Thereupon Siegfried bade the King
take heart and swore so to punish Brunhild that
nevermore should she desire to lay hands upon her
lord; and forthwith they agreed upon a plan whereby
this might be brought about.</p>

<p>That night Brunhild again retired early to her
chamber and Günther approached her with courteous
words; but she scorned him, stormed as before,
and at last threatened to fasten him once more
with her girdle if he would not disclose the secret.
With that Günther blew out the tapers as a signal
to Siegfried, who waited without the door, wearing
the magic cap. He entered, and as Brunhild
was about to seize her royal spouse, he stepped
quickly into Günther’s place, nor was she aware in
the darkness that Siegfried it was whom she had
grasped. Then followed a mighty struggle. Siegfried
was violently hurled to the floor, but quickly
sprang to his feet again, only to be seized once more
by the warrior Queen and crushed between the wall
and an oaken press with such giant strength that
Günther began to despair for the hero’s life. But
rage and shame lent new strength to Siegfried; and
now, although so terrible was Brunhild’s grasp that
the blood started from beneath her nails, with a
mighty effort he regained his feet and overthrew his
formidable adversary, forcing her down till her joints<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
cracked. Then was she fain to yield and cry for
mercy; whereupon Günther, taking Siegfried’s place
again, drew from his unruly wife a vow to restrain
her curiosity till he should see fit to reveal the secret,
and to strive against him no more. And
thereafter he released her, Siegfried meanwhile having
left the room, bearing away with him as spoils
of his victory Brunhild’s ring and girdle, of which
he had possessed himself during the struggle.</p>

<p>After the wedding festivities, which lasted for a
space of two weeks, Siegfried made ready to set out
with his fair bride for Niderland. Günther and his
brothers, out of gratitude for the services Siegfried
had rendered them, would have bestowed much land
upon him as a dowry for Kriemhild, but this the
hero refused, having no wish for reward. At Kriemhild’s
desire, however, an escort of a thousand
knights was granted her, and these she was permitted
to choose, whereupon she bespoke Hagen
and his men. But Hagen grew very wroth at this.
He swore he would be the gift of no man, for his
forefathers had ever served the Court of Burgundy,
and there would he also bide. No other lord than
Günther would he own as liege. The grim knight
was forgiven his harsh words, and Kriemhild made
other choice; nor was this difficult, for many professed
themselves ready to lead the band, among
these the Margrave Eckewart.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>At last was come the time for Siegfried’s departure,
and the King rode far upon the way with him.
After they had parted with many professions of
good-will and friendship, Siegfried sent messengers
on before with word to his parents that he was returning
with the beautiful Kriemhild to Santen,
there to abide thenceforth. Glad news was this indeed
to Siegmund and Sieglind, and their hearts
were filled with joy.</p>

<p><span class="drop-cap2">A</span>NOTHER wedding festival was held at
Santen, even more splendid than that at
Worms. King Siegmund made over the
crown and kingdom to Siegfried, and in
due time a son was born to Kriemhild, whom she
named Günther, for her brother. Messengers were
sent to Burgundy to announce the joyful event, but
at the same time came news to Santen of the birth
of a son likewise to King Günther, and him they
called Siegfried. And now for Siegfried and Kriemhild
ten happy years went by. Great was their love
for each other, and much were they beloved, for
Siegfried ruled the kingdom wisely and with a
mighty arm.</p>

<p>Many times had Brunhild questioned King Günther
concerning Siegfried, seeming to marvel greatly
that he no longer paid service to his liege; but
Günther, though greatly displeased thereat, ever
held his peace, nor would he make reply to her
words. At length she professed a great desire to
see Siegfried and Kriemhild once again, declaring<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
that Günther as his sovereign might command Siegfried’s
presence whensoever it pleased him. Günther,
foreboding evil, made for excuse the great
distance between them, but so strongly did Brunhild
urge the matter that at last the King was forced
to yield and bid his sister with her lord as guests
to Worms.</p>

<p>Now when the Margrave Gere and his thirty
men came to the Netherlands, it chanced that King
Siegfried was then in the land of the Nibelungs, and
thither they sought him, bearing the message from
Günther and Brunhild. Supposing the King to be
again beset by foes he declared himself ready to set
out at once to his relief, but the Margrave made
him aware that not to do battle was he bidden, but
to celebrate the feast of the equinox about to be
held in Worms. Siegfried thereupon took counsel
with his chiefs, who deemed it prudent that he
should go attended by not less than a thousand
knights, while his father, Siegmund, made ready to
accompany him with his own band of a hundred
warriors.</p>

<p>Laden with costly gifts, the messengers returned
to Burgundy with the news that Siegfried would
shortly follow. But when Hagen beheld the treasures
they brought with them he secretly coveted the
Nibelung hoard and longed to see it all in Worms.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Günther had not failed to recall to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
Brunhild the loving welcome she had met with from
Kriemhild when first she came to Burgundy, and
charged her now not to be in any way behind in
her greetings to his sister, and Brunhild gave her
word thereto. On the appointed day the whole
Burgundian court rode forth to meet the expected
guests, and right joyous was their welcome. The
whole city was given up to feasting and rejoicing,
and all went well for eleven days, when a grand
tournament was held. It chanced, as the two
Queens sat at a window looking on at the jousting,
that Kriemhild, rapt in watching Siegfried,
exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Ah! look thou upon my lord! So brave and
knightly doth he bear him, as were the whole world’s
homage but his due.”</p>

<p>This displeased the haughty Brunhild, and she
replied scornfully: “Ay, so indeed, perchance, were
thou and he alone upon the earth.”</p>

<p>But Kriemhild, her gaze still fixed on Siegfried,
continued: “How truly noble is my royal spouse!
Methinks among yon chiefs he is so far the first
as doth the moon outshine the starry host!”</p>

<p>“Rare and matchless though he be, forsooth,”
returned Brunhild, “yet is he not so great a King as
is my Günther!”</p>

<p>At this Kriemhild’s anger began to rise, and she
cried out: “In no way is Siegfried behind thy lord<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
or any man on earth!” Whereupon Brunhild
with an evil glance at Kriemhild declared that
Siegfried with his own lips had owned himself vassal
to King Günther when they came to Iceland for
the wooing. Kriemhild was greatly troubled, yet
she answered proudly:</p>

<p>“Were my lord in truth what thou sayest, then
methinks it passing strange that he hath paid no
tribute to Günther as his liege lord in all these many
years.”</p>

<p>“By my faith, thou dost presume too much!”
cried Brunhild, furiously. “We shall see anon
whether thou or I be most deserving homage!”</p>

<p>With this the Queens parted, bitter anger swelling
in their breasts.</p>

repaired with her women to the cathedral,
Brunhild was before her, and
stood at the door with all her train
clad in their costliest robes, whereat the people wondered
greatly, for the two Queens were wont to
walk side by side in stately procession. Kriemhild
was about to ascend the steps when Brunhild in a
loud voice bade her stand aside, since it was not
seemly that the wife of a vassal should go before
the Queen of Burgundy into the house of God.
This went to Kriemhild’s heart, for she felt the rude
speech injured her beloved Siegfried more than herself.
Beside herself with anger, she cried out:</p>

<p>“Vassal or no vassal, yet my lord is greater than
thine: for know, if thou must, it was he who overcame
thee and delivered thee up to Günther!”</p>

<p>At this Brunhild burst into tears, and Kriemhild,
not desiring to prolong the quarrel, passed into the
church. Brunhild followed, but so filled with burning
rage was she that little did she hear of sermon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
or of song. When the service was ended she
awaited Kriemhild at the door and overwhelming
her with passionate reproaches, demanded the proof
of her words.</p>

<p>Now, Siegfried had given to his wife the ring and
girdle he had taken from Brunhild. During the
service Kriemhild’s anger had cooled, and her wish
was to depart in peace; yet since Brunhild would
not permit this, but grew more and more violent, in
the end Kriemhild drew forth the ring and showed
it to her rival, saying: “If thou wilt have the truth,
by this token was it Siegfried who did conquer
thee!”</p>

<p>“Then, forsooth, hath it been stolen from me!”
retorted Brunhild, changing color.</p>

<p>But now Kriemhild also produced the girdle;
whereupon Brunhild, wringing her hands, burst
into a passion of tears, and both Queens went upon
their way.</p>

<p>Hastily summoning Günther, his weeping spouse
related to him all that had passed, adding that Siegfried
himself must have devised this means of publicly
affronting her. Whereupon Günther forthwith
sought out Siegfried, and he, knowing naught of
the matter, was much disturbed to hear of the
quarrel.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, he bade his comrade soothe the
anger of Brunhild, and vowed therewith soundly to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
reprove his wife for her rash speech. Then was
King Günther glad once more, for he loved Siegfried
and was loath to be at enmity with him. But all
Günther’s efforts to make peace were useless. Brunhild
refused to be appeased; and when Hagen came
to visit her she told him of the insult that had been
offered her, protesting that Siegfried alone had been
the cause thereof. Whereupon Hagen fell into a
terrible passion and swore to avenge his Queen’s
dishonor.</p>

<p>Then came Giselher, and when he had heard all,
he warned Hagen not to be blinded by sudden
anger, dwelling on the good-will and favor Siegfried
had ever borne the King and all the land. Meanwhile
other chiefs came forward, and now Ortwin
spoke out, saying:</p>

<p>“An the King so wills, by my hand the traitor
shall perish; nor shall his mighty strength avail to
save him!”</p>

<p>Yet none was there that found this saying good,
save Hagen, the grim. But with crafty words day
after day he urged Günther on to revenge, dwelling
on the wealth and power that would be his were
Siegfried’s lands with all the Nibelung treasure to
become his own, until at last the temptation grew
too strong for the King, and he yielded himself to
Hagen’s will.</p>

  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/dropcap-h.jpg" width="81" height="75" alt="H">
</div>

<p><span class="drop-cap">H</span>AGEN now bethought him of a plan
whereby he might learn from Kriemhild
the secret of Siegfried’s vulnerable spot.
Some of his men donned the garb of foreign
messengers and appeared at the court, with a
false challenge from Lendeger and Lendegast, the
two Kings Siegfried had formerly vanquished.
Again Günther wavered in his purpose, at the
thought of such treachery toward Siegfried, who
had ever been his loyal friend, and of whose innocence
moreover he felt sure; but Hagen’s evil
counsel once more prevailed, and the voice of his
conscience was stifled.</p>

<p>Siegfried soon perceived that something was
amiss, and questioning Günther as to the cause of
his silence and gloom, drew from him that the
Saxon and Danish Kings had sworn vengeance and
were coming to lay waste the land. Whereupon he
avowed himself ready and eager to meet Günther’s
foes again in battle.</p>

<p>“Do thou bide here,” he said, “whilst I with my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
eleven hundred chosen knights go forth and chastise
this presumptuous pair.”</p>

<p>Joyfully the hero made ready to depart, and
Hagen, who had declared he would ride with them,
went to take leave of Kriemhild. She besought
him to be no longer angry with her for the words
she had spoken to Brunhild, adding:</p>

<p>“I have been punished enough for my folly in
my lord Siegfried’s displeasure!”</p>

<p>“All is forgotten, fair lady,” replied Hagen.
“Nor is it save for love of King Siegfried that I go
with him to this war. Should there be aught
wherein it may avail, be sure he shall not lack
my aid.”</p>

<p>Then was Kriemhild overjoyed and began therewith
to sound the praises of her lord, dwelling on
the love and loyalty he had ever shown toward
Burgundy, and her fear lest through his reckless
valor he might perchance hazard his life.</p>

<p>Whereupon the wily Hagen answered: “Methinks
there can be no danger to thy lord, since he
is proof against all harm; yet tell me, I pray thee,
if by any chance this be not so, that I may know
how best to secure his safety.”</p>

<p>At this, Kriemhild opened her heart to Hagen,
and having full faith in his honesty and loyalty,
confided to him how, when Siegfried had covered
himself with the fat of the dragons, a linden leaf<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
had fallen between his shoulders, leaving one spot
wherein he might come to harm. Thereupon she
charged him anew to guard Siegfried well, lest in the
heat of battle some foe should wound him from
the rear. Overjoyed with the success of his strategy,
Hagen counselled Kriemhild to mark this spot upon
Siegfried’s garment, that he might be the better able
to shield him, and vowing to bide faithfully at his
side in battle, took his leave.</p>

<p>That same evening Kriemhild took the outer
garment of her beloved spouse and wrought with
finest silk upon it a small red cross—his death
mark, alas! for Hagen saw and fixed the spot well
in his mind. The next morning, as Siegfried and
his well-armed followers were about to set forth,
Hagen contrived that other messengers should
appear with the news that the two Kings had taken
counsel and determined to abandon the war with
Burgundy.</p>

<p>“Then have we armed to no purpose!” said
Siegfried to Günther, who nevertheless gave him
thanks with fair but lying words for his willingness
to aid them; and therewith, by Hagen’s counsel, he
urged Siegfried to go with them to a hunt on the
following morning in the Vosges forest, for there it
was that Hagen had planned to accomplish his evil
purpose.</p>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/dropcap-w.jpg" width="95" height="75" alt="W">
</div>

<p><span class="drop-cap">W</span>HEN the morning was come, therefore,
Siegfried made him ready for
the hunt and went to take leave of
Kriemhild. She was full of anxious
forebodings. Hagen’s grim visage rose before her
eyes, and she began to mistrust him and his friendly
words. Bitterly now she repented that her love and
fear for her husband had led her to reveal his vulnerable
spot. Nor did she dare make known to
Siegfried what had passed, for he had strictly forbidden
her ever to speak thereof. She had spent
the night in terror and distress, and evil dreams had
haunted her broken slumbers; wherefore she now
besought Siegfried with tears to abandon the hunt,
clinging to him as if she would never loose her
hold.</p>

<p>“I dreamed last night that two wild boars gave
thee chase,” she cried, “and wounded thee so sorely
that the grass was reddened with thy blood. Surely
that forebodes two foes that seek thy life. Ah! go
not hence, dear lord! I beseech thee, stay!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>Tenderly Siegfried embraced her and sought to
calm her fears, and knowing that he had never
wrought evil to any man but had ever shown kindness
and good-will to all, he said:</p>

<p>“Dispel these idle fears, sweet wife! All thy
kinsmen, methinks, bear me love and favor; nor is
there any that hath cause to do me ill.”</p>

<p>Yet still did Kriemhild weep, saying: “I dreamed
again, and thou didst stand betwixt two lofty mountain
peaks that tottered to their fall. And as I
gazed they plunged together and thou wast swallowed
from my sight. Oh, trust me, lord, some
dire evil will surely chance, an thou dost hunt this
day!”</p>

<p>Alas! had Kriemhild but confessed to Siegfried
all, how different might have been the ending of
this tale! But he kissed away her tears with loving
words of comfort and she dared not speak. Once
again—for the last time upon earth—he clasped
her to his heart and thus they parted. Siegfried,
mounting his horse, rode swiftly to the appointed
place of meeting.</p>

<p>Cheerily the huntsmen took their way to the
Vosges forest, and when they were come thither,
Hagen proposed that all should separate, whereby
at the end it might be seen which was the best
sportsman; and this, in the secret hope that Siegfried’s
boldness and daring might cause him to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
slain by some wild beast, for well he knew the plan
he had devised was fraught with no small danger to
himself.</p>

<p>Siegfried asked only for a single hound to track
his game and Günther bestowed on him a well-trained
beagle; whereupon he set spurs to his
horse and was soon deep in the heart of the
forest. Ere-long a huge wild boar crossed his
path, and he slew it with his sword; and thereafter
a buffalo bull, an elk, four mighty mountain
bulls, and a fierce stag fell before his spear. Retainers
followed and dragged the game into one
heap, while on every side sounded the notes of
the hunting horns and the joyous baying of the
four-and-twenty hounds.</p>

<p>At length, King Günther wound his golden horn
to summon the huntsmen to a repast, and soon all
were assembled in a green glade of the forest, where
a fire burned brightly and the cooks were preparing
a goodly meal of beef and venison. But Siegfried
had roused a bear, and resolving for sport to capture
it alive had pursued it fast and far. At last
the brute sought shelter in a thicket, whereupon
Siegfried sprang from his saddle and, after a short
struggle, had it fast by the skin of its neck. Then
he bound up the jaws with their rows of sharp teeth,
wound a cord about the paws, and laying it across
his horse, set out to join the huntsmen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>Glorious indeed to look upon was the mighty
Siegfried as he rode joyously through the green
forest! Lightly he poised the stout, keen-edged
hunting-spear, and the good sword Balmung hung
downward to his spurs. He wore a silken tunic
of black, glittering with gold ornaments and bordered
with sable, and a cap of the same fur, while
the lining of his quiver was of panther’s hide, the
odor whereof was held to attract the game. He
also carried a long bow of rare workmanship.</p>

<p>When he came to the meeting-place he took the
bear from his horse and unbound it; whereupon
the beast, seeking to escape, bolted in amongst the
pots and kettles and sent the terrified cooks flying
hither and thither. Thereupon a great shout arose
from the amazed huntsmen; the dogs were loosed
and away they all went into the forest in pursuit of
the fleeing captive. Clear rang the horns of the
hunters, loudly bayed the furious pack; yet their
quarry was like to escape them, for none dared use
bow or spear lest he should wound the hounds.
Whereupon Siegfried bounding forward soon outstripped
hounds and huntsmen, and struck the bear
dead with his sword. In triumph they bore it back
to the fire, and all agreed that to Siegfried should be
adjudged the prize. Many indeed who were aware
of Hagen’s fell design would fain have had him
forego the treacherous deed, yet none dared speak<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
of this to him, for well they knew his vengeful
fury.</p>

<p>Soon were the huntsmen seated round the board,
and ample justice did they to the goodly viands
wherewith it was spread; but Siegfried, looking about
for wine, found none at hand. Now, this was part of
Hagen’s plan, yet he excused himself when Günther
questioned him thereon, with the plea that he
had erred in naming the place of the hunt and
the wine therefore had been sent to the Spessart
forest.</p>

<p>Then Siegfried declared he could have wished
they were nearer to the Rhine, for the hunt had
given him a mighty thirst. Whereupon Hagen,
assuming an air of indifference, replied:</p>

<p>“Most noble knight, hard by I know a cool and
limpid spring, whose waters may quench thy thirst.
Let us go thither.”</p>

<p>Those who knew Hagen’s meaning shuddered at
these words, but Siegfried joyfully agreed. Whereat
Hagen said: “Oft have I heard it said, my lord
Siegfried, that none can outstrip thee in running.
Here is good ground for proof, and I myself will
race thee to yon brooklet for a wager!”</p>

<p>“That gladly will I do,” replied Siegfried, “and
with all my armor on.”</p>

<p>Hagen now pointed out the spring and forth
they bounded like two panthers over the grassy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
plain, all the huntsmen following. Siegfried was
the swifter; coming first to the spring he laid
aside his sword, bow, and shield, and leaned his
spear against a linden tree. Had he but drunk
his fill now and taken up his arms once more,
all Hagen’s base scheming would have been undone,
for none had dared to assail the hero armed
and on his guard. But restraining his thirst, he
waited till Günther as sovereign prince should first
have tasted of the spring. The King was third to
reach the spot, the others lagging far behind, for
upon them had come a sudden fear and trembling.
Kneeling by the spring, he drank and thereafter
stooped Siegfried also to dip up the clear cold
water in his hand. Now was Hagen’s time.
Swiftly and noiselessly he bore away the hero’s
sword and bow. Ill indeed had it fared with
the false knight had Siegfried marked his act;
but little thought had he of such foul plot to
reward his loyalty. Seizing the spear, Hagen
hurled it with all his force at Siegfried’s back,
and so well had he marked the spot shown him
by the cross Kriemhild had wrought that the
weapon pierced deep into the breast of the hero
and there remained. The shameful deed was done,
and truly never was there crime on all the earth
more foul than this.</p>

<p>The red blood spouted from the wound upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
the bow of the assassin, and he fled; for, though
wounded to the death, yet was Siegfried terrible
in his wrath. Springing to his feet, the hero
sought his weapons, but they were gone; whereupon
with shield aloft he rushed after Hagen
and smote him therewith so powerfully that it
burst asunder, scattering a shower of jewels all
about. Hagen was stretched upon the ground,
and it seemed his end had come. But now the
strength fled from Siegfried, a deadly pallor overspread
his countenance, and he sank upon the
ground, his life blood staining the grass and flowers
crimson. Then Hagen arose and drew nigh, his
dark features lit with savage joy at the success of
his evil work.</p>

<p>Günther, too, approached, and after him came
the rest of the huntsmen, and a deathly stillness
reigned as all gazed upon the dying hero. At
last Siegfried broke the silence. In noble wrath
he spoke:</p>

<p>“Ye dastards! to slay me from behind, and this
as meed for all the service I have rendered you!”</p>

<p>The glance of the hero, wounded unto death,
appalled the stoutest hearts; rough cheeks were
wet with tears; and even from Günther’s breast
was forced a cry of anguish. But Siegfried was
not deceived thereby. Clearly now he saw the
whole treacherous plot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>“Too late is it now, King Günther of Burgundy,
to bewail the evil thou thyself hast wrought; better
for thee had it been left undone.”</p>

<p>And Hagen with a scornful glance at his comrades
cried fiercely: “Fools! Wherefore, then, do ye
lament? Is not this an end to all our discontent?
Well was it that I had the will to do the deed against
your craven counsel!”</p>

<p>Again the hero spoke, although his voice grew
faint: “Vaunt not thyself too much my lord,
Hagen! Had I but known thee for the base
assassin that thou art, thy schemes had been of
small avail against me. For naught I grieve save
Kriemhild, my true and loving wife, and that my
son must one day learn how his sire was foully slain
by his nearest kin.”</p>

<p>All grew dark before his eyes, yet still his
thoughts were with his wife; her name the last
upon his lips. “If aught there yet be within
thy breast of faith or loyalty,” he said to Günther,
“then be thou true unto thy sister Kriemhild!
My father and my brave knights now, alas,
will wait for me in vain. Oh, never yet hath man
so basely dealt by his true friend as thou by me!”</p>

<p>Thereupon the death struggle seized him, but it
was soon over; his eyes grew dim, and the soul of
the mighty Siegfried took its flight.</p>

<p>When they saw that he was dead, they laid his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
body on a golden shield upon which to bear it away,
and thereafter they took counsel as to what should
be done. Some thought it well to say that thieves
had slain King Siegfried, but Hagen spoke out
boldly, saying:</p>

<p>“I myself will take him back to Worms. It is
naught to me if Kriemhild learns ’twas by my hand
he died. He defamed our Queen, and for that wrong
his life has paid the price, forsooth. Little care I
for Kriemhild’s tears or moans.”</p>

<p>So they waited till the pale moon stood high in
the heavens, and then, bearing the corpse of Siegfried,
King Günther and his companions once more
crossed the Rhine.</p>

<p><span class="drop-cap">H</span>AGEN had bethought him of a plan to
make his terrible revenge complete, by
leaving Kriemhild to find the body of her
lord before her door. And so it was, for,
when at daybreak the bells for matins sounded from
the minster spire and Kriemhild awakened her
women to go with her to service as was their wont,
the chamberlain coming to attend them saw the
body without her chamber. Thereupon the door
opened and the Queen would have come forth, but
the chamberlain, raising his torch to light the passage,
warned her to go back, till he should have
borne the body thence. But Kriemhild straightway
divining what had befallen, uttered a loud shriek
and fell senseless to the ground. When she had
come to herself again her women sought to calm
her, saying the corpse was surely of some stranger
knight, but Kriemhild, wringing her hands, cried
out:</p>

<p>“Ah no! it is my lord, foully slain by Günther,
and Brunhild it was who urged him to the deed!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>Bending over the lifeless form, while the chamberlain
lowered his torch, she gently lifted the head and
laid it on her knee; and therewith, disfigured as the
noble features were, she knew it for her husband.</p>

<p>“Woe is me!” she cried, “by no good sword
stroke hath his shield been shattered. ’Twas a
murderer’s hand that laid my Siegfried low!”</p>

<p>Thereupon she caused the Nibelungs to be
awakened and a messenger despatched to Siegmund.
The aged King had passed a sleepless night so fearful
was he for his son; yet this terrible news he
could not credit, but hastened to Kriemhild only to
find her in an agony of grief, surrounded by her
weeping women. When the Nibelungs came and
saw the lifeless body of their King, they cried aloud
in bitter wrath and woe, and drawing their swords,
would have avenged his death forthwith; but Kriemhild
restrained them, and there before them all she
took a solemn oath never to rest till she had found
the murderer and wrought vengeance upon him for
the bloody deed.</p>

<p>Then Siegfried’s wounds were washed, his body
clothed in costly garments and raised upon a bier,
and thereafter borne to the cathedral amid tolling
of bells and chanting of hymns, while all the people
flocked to look upon the hero and join in bewailing
his death. Thither too came Günther and Hagen
with a great show of grief and horror, to join the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
mourners. But Kriemhild bade her brother cease
his lamentations, since but for him her husband
then had been alive.</p>

<p>Günther stoutly denied this, and swore that
Siegfried had been slain by robbers in the forest;
whereupon Kriemhild demanded that he and all his
followers should singly approach the bier. Günther
and his two brothers strode past it in silence; then
came Hagen, and when he stood beside the corpse,
lo! the wounds began to bleed afresh. Again
Günther maintained that they were innocent, but
Kriemhild, fixing her gaze full on Hagen, cried
aloud in grief and wrath:</p>

<p>“Now do I know his murderer!”</p>

<p>A great coffin, long and wide, of silver and gold
embossed with knobs of steel, was made ready and
therein, wrapped in a winding sheet of richest silk,
Siegfried’s body was laid. For three days and
nights it rested in the minster, and Kriemhild
watched beside it. She neither ate nor drank, but
besought God to have pity on her and let her also
die, that she might be laid with her husband in the
tomb.</p>

<p>On the third day the funeral rites were held;
and when they were ended, Kriemhild caused the
coffin lid to be raised, and in an agony of grief embraced
the corpse of her beloved and kissed the pale
lips for the last time. Swooning she was borne away;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
and thereupon, amid tolling of bells and the sobs of
the multitude, was the mighty hero laid to rest
within the minster vault.</p>

<p>After some days had passed, Siegmund sought
Kriemhild and said to her: “Now let us depart
to our own land, my daughter; for here methinks
we are but unwelcome guests.”</p>

<p>But thereon came Gernot and Giselher, the King’s
two brothers, who were guiltless of the death of
Siegfried, and with loving words besought her to
abide with them.</p>

<p>For a time Kriemhild hesitated, but the thought
of departing from the burial place of her beloved
spouse cost her such pangs that at the last she
yielded and promised her brothers to remain in
Worms. Siegmund bade farewell to none but
Kriemhild, and bowed with grief, the aged King
and his faithful Nibelungs mounted their steeds and
rode away from the land of the Burgundians, never
to return.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="drop-cap">I</span>N a castle hard by the minster, Kriemhild now
spent her sorrowful days, mourning her lost
husband and going daily to pray beside his
tomb. Thus three long years went by and no
word did she speak to Günther, nor did she once
see Hagen in all that time.</p>

<p>But Hagen never ceased to urge the King to
make his peace with her, for in no other way might
the Nibelung hoard be brought to Worms; and
at last this was brought about by the King’s two
brothers. At the cost of many tears Kriemhild forgave
every one save Hagen, but little for that cared
the grim hero. His mind was set upon the treasure
which had been Siegfried’s marriage gift to his wife.
Soon Kriemhild was persuaded to send for it, whereupon
Gernot and Giselher with eight thousand men
were despatched to the land of the Nibelungs to
claim the hoard. Had Alberich, the Dwarf-King,
still possessed the magic cap, none could have
forced him to give up the treasure; but Siegfried
had taken it from him, and he needs must obey<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
Kriemhild’s commands. In four days and nights,
twelve wagons going to and fro had transported the
great heap of gold and jewels to the ship from its
resting-place within the mountain; and thus was
the mighty Nibelung hoard, so famed in song and
story, brought at last to Worms. There the two
princes gave it into Kriemhild’s keeping; and so
vast was the treasure that it filled whole vaults and
towers, nor did it ever grow less however much was
taken from it.</p>

<p>After some time had passed, Hagen said to Günther:
“Of a truth, the lady Kriemhild doth dispense
her riches with an open hand, and therewith
bestow great charities, alike to high and low. Ere-long
she will gain so many friends and followers
that peril may well ensue to ourselves, wherefore,
methinks, ’twere better far to keep the hoard.”</p>

<p>To this Günther replied that the gold was her
own, to do with as she would; moreover, he had
sworn to do her no more wrong. But Hagen so
beset his royal master, offering himself to bear the
blame, that at the last Günther yielded, and Hagen
thereupon possessed himself of the keys to the
treasure.</p>

<p>Now, at this time it chanced that the Burgundians
were about to set forth on some warlike expedition,
and the youthful Giselher, full of wrath at this fresh
injury to his beloved sister, swore to lend her his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
aid as soon as ever he should return. But Hagen
abode in Worms, and, fearing lest the keys should
be taken from him, availed himself of the King’s
absence to bury the hoard beneath the Rhine, hoping
thereby to keep it for his own. But not thus
had fate decreed. Being well aware that the King’s
brothers would not easily forgive this bold act, he
left the court for a space to wait till their wrath
should have cooled.</p>

<p>Thus with new sorrows was Kriemhild oppressed,
and still more bitter grew her wrath and hatred
toward Hagen. Not content with the murder of
Siegfried, he must also take from her the means of
aiding the poor and suffering, and this had been the
only solace of her darkened life.</p>

<small><i>King Etzel Woos Kriemhild</i></small></h2>
</div>

</div>

<p><span class="drop-cap">I</span>N those days there reigned over the Huns a
mighty King who was called Etzel (Attila).
His royal castle, Etzelburg (now called Ofen),
was on the Danube, and his kingdom stretched
far beyond the boundaries of what is now known as
Hungary. Great was his fame and many were the
lands over which he held sway, so that not only had
the dukes and margraves as his subjects, but also
kings did homage to him. His good Queen Helcha
was dead, and such were the tales that reached him
of the beauty and virtue of Kriemhild that he resolved
to seek her hand; accordingly, Margrave
Rüdiger, one of his richest and bravest knights, was
sent to lay his suit before her.</p>

<p>When at the end of their long journey Rüdiger
and his followers rode into the courtyard of the
castle at Worms, none knew him. Hagen was
therewith sent for, and he, having many years before
lived for a space at Etzel’s court, declared the
stranger knight to be Rüdiger, and counselled the
King to receive him well. Thereupon the margrave<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
was conducted to the great hall, where Günther
gave him kindly welcome, seated him near his own
person, and caused wine to be served him from
his own flagon. After they had sat for a time Rüdiger
arose and made known his errand, namely, that
King Etzel desired to make Kriemhild his wife.
Günther promised him an answer in three days, and
therewith took counsel privately with his brothers
and nearest of kin.</p>

<p>All were agreed that it would be well for the
King’s widowed sister to wed the King of the
Huns, save Hagen, who stoutly declared the betrothal
should in no wise be permitted, protesting
that evil would surely come of it, for Kriemhild
would find means to avenge herself upon them.
To this Günther replied that Etzel’s kingdom was
too remote to be a danger to them, and Giselher rebuked
Hagen, saying:</p>

<p>“Methinks my sister hath already suffered enough
at thy hands. Seek not to thwart what yet perchance
may bring her joy!”</p>

<p>Still Hagen maintained that they one day would
rue it if they scorned his counsel; but none the
less the princes resolved that Kriemhild should
make her own choice. The Margrave Gere was
sent forthwith to acquaint her with King Etzel’s
desire. The sorrowing Queen at first deemed it
but another plan of Hagen’s to mock her grief; but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
when Gere assured her that it was no jest, she replied
that she had no wish to wed, but sought only
to spend her days in mourning her dead lord.</p>

<p>The next day came Rüdiger himself to urge his
master’s suit. Kriemhild greeted him kindly, but
bade him tell King Etzel that none who knew her
grief for Siegfried would seek to win her hand.
Thereupon Rüdiger sought to tempt her with the
wealth and honor that would be hers as the wife
of the mighty Etzel, but all in vain; nor were the
counsels of her mother and brothers of any avail to
move her from her purpose. Still Rüdiger did not
despair, but again making plain to her the power
she would have as Queen of all the Huns, added
significantly:</p>

<p>“Moreover, gracious lady, hadst thou e’er a
wrong to be avenged, thou couldst depend on my
good sword.”</p>

<p>At these words Kriemhild’s hatred against Hagen
blazed up more fiercely than before. With flashing
eyes she called on Rüdiger to pledge his word
thereto; and this he did, little foreseeing in what
manner he should one day be called upon to redeem
it.</p>

<p>Thereupon Kriemhild consented to become the
wife of King Etzel and, bidding farewell to all her
kin, departed with Rüdiger for the land of the
Huns.</p>

<small><i>Etzel’s Invitation to Günther</i></small></h2>
</div>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/dropcap-w.jpg" width="95" height="75" alt="W">
</div>

<p><span class="drop-cap">W</span>HEN Etzel learned that Kriemhild
was coming, he rode gallantly forth
to meet his bride with a long train of
knights and courtiers. Kings and
dukes were there withal, and banners of many countries
waved above the host. For seventeen days
the wedding festivities lasted; nor had Kriemhild
in all her life seen aught to equal the splendor and
magnificence that now surrounded her.</p>

<p>Six years went by. Kriemhild had borne a son
who was called Ortlieb, and she was happy at Etzel’s
court; yet still was she tormented with the thought
that Siegfried’s murderer yet lived. The theft of
the Nibelung hoard she had indeed forgiven, but
her deadly wrath at the foul treachery to her beloved
husband had known no change.</p>

<p>“Oh, that Hagen were but here!” she often
sighed as she cast about her for some means whereby
this might be brought to pass; for well she knew
that he would never come alone. At last she bethought
her of a plan. Seeking the King one day
when in a gracious mood, she said to him:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>“Most generous lord! one cause of grief and
shame have I, in that my kindred never visit me.
Methinks it will be said that I came to thee an exile,
or that my kin disown me. Wherefore I pray thee,
let them be summoned hither as our guests, and
thereby wilt thou greatly relieve my troubles.”</p>

<p>King Etzel kindly granted this request and forthwith
despatched messengers to Worms to bid the
Burgundian princes to the approaching festival of
the Summer solstice. Before they departed, however,
Kriemhild summoned them to her and charged
them to see to it that all her kinsmen came, even to
her uncle Hagen; and furthermore, if they should
be questioned concerning her, to say that she was
well and of good cheer.</p>

<p>Thereupon the messengers set out for Worms.
Günther gave them such welcome as befitted the
envoys of so powerful a ruler, and much rejoiced
was he to hear of Kriemhild’s contentment, for now
it seemed she had at last forgotten all the past. A
council was held, and all were for accepting King
Etzel’s bidding save Hagen, who grew angry when
urged thereto. Casting a black look at Günther,
he asked if he had forgotten how Siegfried was
slain.</p>

<p>“’Twas by my hand he fell, in truth; but thou
wast partner to the deed!”</p>

<p>Earnestly he strove to dissuade them from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
journey, pointing out the danger of putting themselves
in the power of Kriemhild, whose vengeance
never slept. But the princes refused to abide by
his counsel, and Giselher, who of all the brothers
was best loved by Kriemhild, exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Thou art the guilty one, not we! An thou
dost tremble for thy life, bide here; but as for us,
our wish is that we ride thither without delay.”</p>

<p>Then Hagen urged no more, but made ready to
accompany them, since shame it were for him to
stay behind. Yet he warned Günther as a safeguard
to take with him a thousand of the stoutest champions
in the land; and this he did, leaving Hagen to
choose them. And when all were fully armed and
ready, they set out on their fateful journey to the
land of the Huns.</p>

<small><i>The Swan-Maidens</i></small></h2>
</div>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/dropcap-t.jpg" width="76" height="75" alt="T">
</div>

<p><span class="drop-cap">T</span>OWARD the Main they took their way,
Hagen leading, for well he knew the
ground. Proudly they rode, a thousand
gallant knights, and behind them came
full nine thousand stout retainers. On the twelfth
morning they came to the Danube and found the
river far and near had overflowed its banks; whereat
Hagen’s brow grew dark, but Günther bade him
seek some means of crossing.</p>

<p>“Forsooth,” said he, “I care as little as another
to meet death within yon waves, for many a Hun I
trust shall yet by my hand breathe his last!”
Therewith he rode on before to seek a boatman.
Well was he armed, with his stout shield and helm
and hauberk of polished steel and his heavy two-edged
sword buckled to his mail. As he drew near
the stream he heard the splashing of water, and
looking about saw two nymphs disporting themselves
therein, their golden hair floating far behind them,
while on the green bank lay their wondrous swan-garments.
Hagen stooped quickly and snatched<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
them up, whereupon Hadburg, one of the nymphs
(mermaidens), called to him:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“Sir Hagen bold, so thou return</div>
<div class="indent">Our raiment on the spot,</div>
<div class="verse">We’ll tell thee of thy journey’s end,</div>
<div class="indent">And what will be thy lot!”</div>
</div></div>

<p>This was much to Hagen’s mind, and he agreed
thereto. Then the swan-maiden said:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="first">“With ample safety ye may ride</div>
<div class="indent">Into King Etzel’s land:</div>
<div class="verse">I pledge on this my truth and troth,</div>
<div class="indent">And therewithal my hand,</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="first">“That never noble king’s array</div>
<div class="indent">Did win in foreign State,</div>
<div class="verse">Such honor and such lofty fame,</div>
<div class="indent">Believe—such is your fate.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Overjoyed at these words, Hagen restored to the
nymphs their strange garments; and no sooner had
they donned them than straightway they became
white swans.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Then spake the other water-nymph,</div>
<div class="indent">This one Sieglind’s hight:</div>
<div class="verse">“I warn thee, Hagen Tronege,</div>
<div class="indent">Sir Adrian’s son of might,</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
<div class="first">“That to obtain the clothes, my aunt</div>
<div class="indent">Has said what is not true:</div>
<div class="verse">For shouldst thou journey to the Huns,</div>
<div class="indent">That journey thou shalt rue.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="first">“Turn back again, ye heroes,</div>
<div class="indent">There yet is time, I ween;</div>
<div class="verse">For ye to this high festival,</div>
<div class="indent">Have only bidden been</div>
</div>

<div class="indent">In royal Etzel’s land;</div>
<div class="verse">And all who thither ride,</div>
<div class="indent">To death extend the hand!”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Then Hagen, seized with fury, cried: “Now, by
my faith, thou liest in thy speech! No cause is it
for all to die that one among us hath incurred deep
hate.”</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Again the nymph in sorrow spoke:</div>
<div class="indent">“Yet fate hath so declared,</div>
<div class="verse">Of all your gallant company</div>
<div class="indent">Shall only one be spared—</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="first">“And he, the chaplain of the King,</div>
<div class="indent">As we full well do know,</div>
<div class="verse">He only, home returning, to</div>
<div class="indent">King Günther’s land shall go.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Then would Hagen hear no more, but asked if
there was no ferryman at hand. She told him the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
ferryman’s house was on the other bank of the
Danube, and warned him to be on his guard with
the man and speak him fair, or evil might come of
it, for he was of wrathful temper and a stout liegeman
of the prince to whom the land on that side of
the river belonged.</p>

<p>At this Hagen looked scornfully and rode away,
but again the Swan-maidens called to him, and bade
him call himself Amelrich, for that name would
surely bring the boatman. Therewith they arose
in the air in their swan-garments and soon had vanished
from sight. When Hagen spied the house
across the stream he gave a mighty shout which
brought the ferryman to the door. Hanging a
heavy gold clasp upon the point of his sword,
Hagen held it aloft so that it gleamed in the sunlight,
and offered it to him, at the same time calling
himself Amelrich, whereupon the doughty boatman
seized the oars and rowed his boat across the river.
No sooner had it touched the bank than Hagen
sprang quickly into it, but the man shouted furiously:</p>

<p>“Now hast thou lied to me! Thou art not my
brother Amelrich, so on this side mayst thou bide,
forsooth!”</p>

<p>Hagen’s brow darkened, yet still he sought to
speak him fair. “I am a stranger here,” he said,
“and with me ride a thousand knights and many
followers besides. We would fain go on our way,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
wherefore take this gold and ferry us across the
stream.”</p>

<p>“My lord hath many enemies,” replied the ferryman,
“and ill were it for me to fetch armed strangers
to his lands. Nay, get thee hence, Sir Knight!”</p>

<p>Still Hagen would not stir; whereupon the ferryman,
swinging his oar aloft, smote him so mightily
that he fell upon his knee. Quickly the hero
sprang to his feet, only to receive a second blow on
his helm, which split the oar with a loud crash.
Thereupon Hagen grew mad with rage and drawing
his sword he struck off the boatman’s head. Down
it fell into the river and after it he cast the body.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the current had caught the boat and
borne it down the stream. Hagen seized the second
oar and sought therewith to turn it back, but the
current was strong and so powerful were his strokes
that the oar broke asunder. Now was he indeed in
sorry plight, but cutting a thong from his shield he
quickly spliced the oar and gained once more the
mastery of the craft.</p>

<p>Soon Günther and his followers perceived the
bold mariner coming up the river and joyfully
hailed him. But when he reached the bank they
looked aghast at the blood in the bottom of the
boat. The King cried out:</p>

<p>“Hagen, what hast thou done? Thou hast slain
the ferryman.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>But Hagen denied it, saying: “Fast to a willow
tree I found the boat, and therein was the blood,
already spilled.”</p>

<p>Then Gernot said: “Methinks no farther are we
like to fare, for of what use is the boat without a
ferryman?”</p>

<p>Thereupon Hagen declared he would ferry them
across himself. Bidding the princes enter the boat
and with them as many knights as it would hold, he
soon had landed them upon the farther bank; and
thus going back and forth, he brought all safely
over. The horses were driven into the water, and
when they saw their masters on the other side and
heard their voices, they gallantly swam the stream.
Neighing for joy they climbed the bank, shook the
water from their sides and galloped to their masters,
who greeted them with kindly words. Nor were any
lost, though many were carried far down the stream.</p>

<p>While Hagen was ferrying the men across, his
eye fell upon the King’s chaplain, and bethinking
him of the Swan-maiden’s word that he alone of
them all was to return to Burgundy, he resolved to
bring to naught this part of the prophecy at least.
Seizing the priest, he dragged him to the side of
the boat and, despite his cries, cast him into the
rushing flood. Loudly did the knights protest
against this misdeed, but none dared openly to
resist the fierce champion. Soon the priest rose to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
the surface and clung to the side of the boat, but
Hagen with the oar thrust him off, deep under the
water; whereupon, not being able to swim, he gave
himself up for lost. But the swift current bore him
once more to land, and then, thanking God for his
escape, he fled and made his way back to the Rhine.</p>

<p>It was plain to Hagen that all must come to pass
as the Swan-maidens had foretold, and when the
last man had reached the shore, he seized the heavy
iron-tipped oar and smote the bow of the boat so
that it broke asunder and presently sank. With
wonder and dismay the knights beheld this deed of
Hagen’s, and one ventured to ask him wherefore he
had destroyed the boat that might have served them
to cross the stream on their return. Within himself
he thought, as we all are doomed to death no
more need have we for boats; but to them he made
answer, saying:</p>

<p>“Should any among us be so faint-hearted as to
seek to return, he shall find no means thereto, but
meet his end ignobly in the waves!”</p>

<p>But none was pleased with this save Volker, a
stanch friend of Hagen’s. No stouter or more
valiant knight was there in all the band than he, and
to Hagen he clove most loyally, swearing to abide
by him to the end, whatever might betide.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="drop-cap2">A</span>FTER Günther and his knights had ridden
on again for a space, Hagen made known
to them the dark prophecy of the Swan-maidens.
Quickly the news spread
throughout the host, and many a heart sank, and
many a cheek grew pale thereat; yet retreat was no
longer possible, for the boat was gone.</p>

<p>Soon they came to the lands of Rüdiger, the
margrave, who in former days had wooed Kriemhild
for King Etzel. Right gladly were they welcomed
by that brave and hospitable knight, and
they spent three days at his castle in feasting and
good cheer. At that time Rüdiger’s fair daughter
won the heart of Giselher, and her parents willingly
gave their consent to the betrothal, promising
that the marriage should be celebrated on the return
of the Burgundians. Alas! that never was
to be.</p>

<p>But now no longer might they tarry, for already
messengers had been sent to Etzel to warn him of
their approach, and on the fourth morning they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
took their leave. Rüdiger bestowed rich gifts upon
the princes and their kinsmen, and himself rode with
them to the royal castle, Etzelburg, the shining
towers whereof soon rose before them. It chanced
that Dietrich, the Prince of Bern, who aforetime
had slain the mighty Ecke, was then at Etzel’s court
with the ancient Hildebrand; and fearing some evil
to the Burgundians, they rode forth to meet them
on their way. Hagen knew the two knights from
afar and said to Günther:</p>

<p>“Yonder come Sir Dietrich and Hildebrand; let
us dismount and go on foot to meet them!”
Whereupon all the knights also dismounted. Dietrich
and Hildebrand did the same, and the heroes
exchanged friendly greetings. Then Dietrich told
them of his fears, warning them that Kriemhild’s
grief for Siegfried had known no change.</p>

<p>“’Tis of small avail to weep for Siegfried,” said
Hagen, insolently, “since dead he is and dead will
he remain, for all her tears.”</p>

<p>“Ay, that indeed!” replied Dietrich, with a stern
glance at Hagen, “and pity is it, God wot, that
King Siegfried lives no more. But Kriemhild’s
vengeance still doth live; and thereby, much I fear
me, evil is in store for you.”</p>

<p>Günther started; yet, seeking to allay his fears,
he asked: “Are we not here by Etzel’s own request?
Surely your King would not deal falsely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
by his guests; and Kriemhild long since made
peace with us.”</p>

<p>But Hagen, wishing to know all the truth, urged
Dietrich to speak freely. Whereupon he, taking
Günther apart, told him how Kriemhild each morning
bewailed the untimely death of Siegfried, with
tears and prayers to God for vengeance.</p>

<p>Then out-spoke the bold and jovial Volker:
“Now, in good sooth, my lords, we must endure
those evils that we cannot cure with what grace we
can. Let us not dampen our courage with fears for
what the future may bring forth!” And therewith
they resumed their journey.</p>

<p>When they came to the castle, the gates were
flung open and the Huns poured forth in crowds to
gaze at the Burgundian heroes with all their glittering
train. Many eyes sought Hagen, for well was
he known in the land of the Huns as the slayer of
Siegfried the mighty; and all were struck with
wonder at his massive frame no less than his
haughty bearing and fierce aspect. Broad were his
chest and shoulders, his black hair slightly tinged
with gray, while his bold gaze roved restlessly
about from beneath his shaggy eyebrows.</p>

<p>King Etzel, with Kriemhild, stood at the window
as the Burgundians on their gayly decked steeds
rode into the spacious courtyard. When his eye
fell upon Hagen he turned to his courtiers,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
demanding: “Who may yon haughty chieftain
be?”</p>

<p>“’Tis Hagen, son to old Sir Adrian, a bold and
wrathful knight, my lord,” said one.</p>

<p>“Ha!” cried the King, “’tis little strange I did
not know him; for though he once was here at
court, yet then forsooth, was he but a careless
stripling.”</p>

<p>The stranger knights were housed within the
castle as became their rank, but for the retainers
lodging was prepared in other quarters far removed
therefrom. This Kriemhild had planned for her
own purposes. Now she went forth to welcome
her kinsmen. Giselher, who was guiltless of Siegfried’s
death, she kissed and embraced fondly, but
none other did she greet in this fashion. When
Hagen marked this, he tightened the band of
his helm and cast a meaning glance at Günther.
After she had greeted all, she turned to Hagen,
saying:</p>

<p>“Welcome art thou to one who gladly sees thee
here. Yet tell me, I pray thee, what hast thou
brought me from the Rhine?”</p>

<p>“Now, by my faith,” quoth Hagen, “thou art
rich in gold and power, and yet dost ask what
largess I bring!”</p>

<p>“I desire no gifts of thee,” said Kriemhild,
coldly. “I want that which is my own. Where<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
is the treasure that thou didst withhold from
me?”</p>

<p>“In sooth, most potent Queen,” cried Hagen,
“’tis many a day since I have seen the hoard.
Wouldst thou know the spot where it is hidden?
Full deep beneath the broad Rhine was it sunk,
and there shall it abide until the Judgment Day!”</p>

<p>“I knew full well thou wouldst not bring it
hither,” continued Kriemhild; “and for it I will
hold thee to account; as also for the murder of my
noble lord!”</p>

<p>With a scornful look, Hagen replied: “Now by
my faith, this buckler broad, and my coat of mail
and two-edged sword beside, are weight enough to
carry. In sooth, I nothing else have brought.”</p>

<p>Thereupon Kriemhild declared that no weapons
might be worn within the royal hall; but if he
would entrust his arms to the care of her retainers,
she would see to it that they were well guarded.</p>

<p>“Gramercy!” cried Hagen, “it were an honor
far too great—for a Queen to serve as armorer. It
must not be. Thou hast my thanks, fair dame;
but for my arms, methinks they best were guarded
by myself.”</p>

<p>“Ah! now I see,” said Kriemhild, angrily,
“it must be thou hast had warning to doubt
my faith. Would I but knew who spake such
words to thee!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>Whereupon Dietrich of Bern stepped proudly
forth and said, “’Twas I, O Queen, who warned
thy kin, and I do not shame to own it.”</p>

<p>At this Kriemhild grew red with shame and
anger, and turned away without a word, but cast
upon her enemy, as she went, a swift glance of
deadly hatred.</p>

called to him, and together they crossed
the courtyard and seated themselves
upon a stone bench which faced the
Queen’s palace hall. Many wondering glances
followed the two mighty Burgundian heroes, and
soon Kriemhild from her window beheld her foe.
Whereupon a passion of grief and rage seized her,
and she broke into such bitter weeping that one of
her knights drew near and said:</p>

<p>“Most gracious Queen, make known to us
what wrong doth grieve thee so, for fain would
we avenge it.”</p>

<p>“Now, on my faith, thou speakest in good time,
Sir Knight; for whoso doth avenge this wrong of
mine shall thereby earn my lifelong thanks, and
well will I reward him.” Then pointing to Hagen,
she cried: “’Tis vengeance on yon chief I seek.

would I have his life!”</p>

<p>Quickly arming themselves, sixty stout warriors<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
declared that Hagen and Volker should die forthwith;
but Kriemhild restrained them, saying: “Too
few are ye to cope with yonder pair. Little ye
reck of Hagen’s mighty strength, though somewhat
thereof doth his look bespeak. And Volker is yet
mightier.”</p>

<p>When the Huns heard this they hastened to
summon more heroes to their aid, and Kriemhild
said to them: “Bide ye here a space, my gallant
friends, whilst I place the crown upon my head.
I will confront my foe as Queen of Huns and tax
him with his crime, that you may hear from his
own lips ’twas he that did the deed.”</p>

<p>When Volker saw the Queen descending the
broad stairs followed by a band of heavily armed
knights, he said to Hagen: “Why doth the Queen
approach with such a train? Methinks they come
with no good intent.”</p>

<p>“Truly ’tis with some purpose,” replied Hagen.
“Yet were there none save these in the land of
the Huns to bar my way, then should I well, in
truth, ride safely home again! But tell me, Volker,
since we may come to blows, wilt thou faithfully
abide by me, as I will pledge my loyal service unto
thee?”</p>

<p>“By the mass, I will!” cried Volker, and therewith
gave his strong right hand to Hagen. “Aye,
though the King and all his host should come<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
against us, yet would I stand beside thee, nor
budge an inch as long as breath remained.”</p>

<p>“God prosper thee for such knightly words!”
said Hagen. “Now let them come! With Volker
fighting by my side, why should I fear?”</p>

<p>As the long train moved slowly across the courtyard,
Volker said: “Were it not well to rise and
greet the Queen? ’Tis but the custom of the
court.”</p>

<p>But Hagen answered wrathfully: “Wouldst thou
then that I show courtesy to one I hate? Nay, as
for that, forsooth, the Huns would think ’twas
fear that urged me to it. Keep thy seat, an thou
dost love me, Volker.”</p>

<p>Hereupon Hagen, with intent to wound the
Queen in cruel fashion, lifted the great sword,
Balmung, which he had borne since Siegfried’s
death, and laid it across his knees, where Kriemhild’s
gaze must straightway fall upon it. Upon
the hilt there blazed a jewel, green as grass, the
sheath was crimson, and the handle all of ruddy
gold.</p>

<p>Kriemhild stood before him; and when she saw
the sword that her beloved spouse so long had
borne, hot tears of anguish overflowed her eyes.
Whereat a gleam of savage joy passed over Hagen’s
face; but Volker drew his sword nearer to him on
the bench, and both heroes sat undaunted before<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
the Queen and all her men. Then Kriemhild demanded
haughtily of Hagen how he had dared
come thither, knowing what he had done, and
furthermore, who had sought his presence.</p>

<p>Whereto Hagen replied: “None, O Queen, did
summon me; yet since my master was bidden by
thy lord, I also am come as a true liegeman.”</p>

<p>Hereupon Kriemhild taxed him openly with the
foul deed he had done upon her lord; and Hagen
turned upon her fiercely, crying: “What need
have we to speak of that? Truly ’twas I that
slew your Siegfried, nor do I fear to own it. I
am here, and any one who pleaseth may seek
vengeance on me!”</p>

<p>“Now you have heard!” cried Kriemhild to her
Hunnish knights. “He hath confessed the deed
that wrought me such deep woe. Deal with him as
doth best befit; nor will I question aught thereof.”</p>

<p>But as the Huns gazed upon the two mighty
champions and listened to Hagen’s fierce words,
they lost heart, and none would venture to attack
them. They looked at one another, and one said:
“’Twere but certain death to assault these two!”</p>

<p>“Thou speakest truly,” added a second, “not for
whole castles of ruddy gold would I encounter
Hagen! As for the other—his fiery glances bent
upon us are enough. I would not care to meet
the greetings of his sword.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>A third said: “I know Sir Hagen of old; in
two and twenty battles I have seen him fight, and
many a mother’s son in warfare he hath slain.
Then he was but a youth, while now he is to stalwart
manhood grown, and his frame doth appear as if
wrought of iron.”</p>

<p>“Naught for his valor would I care,” cried yet
another; “did he not bear Siegfried’s sword, and
where keen Balmung once doth strike, a life is
ended.”</p>

<p>Thus argued the Huns amongst themselves,
none daring to provoke the conflict; whereupon
Kriemhild in bitter anger and chagrin departed, to
devise some other plan, while her warriors slowly
dispersed.</p>

<p>“Truly,” said Volker, “it is even as thou sayest,
friend Hagen: the Queen thirsts for vengeance.
Let us to our King, lest he should need us by his
side.”</p>

<p>Therewith they arose and strode fearlessly
through the midst of their foes to the outer courtyard,
where they found the Burgundian princes
with their knights about to proceed in stately procession
to the palace hall to greet the King.
Dietrich of Bern walked with Günther, Rüdiger
with Giselher, while Hagen and Volker followed on
behind; nor from this time were these two comrades
ever seen apart. As they entered the hall,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
King Etzel rose from his golden throne and advanced
to meet them with gracious words of
welcome. Nor was there aught of guile or falsehood
in his soul. With no thought of what was
in the heart of his wife or wherefore her kinsmen
had been summoned, he rejoiced to see so many
noble guests and heroes of renown assembled at his
court. Leading them to the festal board, he caused
wine and mead to be poured for them in golden
cups and right joyously they passed the hours till
evening came.</p>

<p><span class="drop-cap2">L</span>OW burned the tapers in the royal hall,
and as the midnight hour drew nigh, anxious
thoughts arose in the minds of the
Burgundians. They longed for morning
light to dawn. At last Günther prayed the King
that they might be permitted to seek their rest;
whereupon Etzel gave orders that they should be
shown to their lodgings, and with hearty good-will
wished them sound slumbers. As they followed
the torch-bearers, the Huns came crowding about
them so closely that their way was stopped, but
Volker drew his sword and sprang forward, shouting:
“Give place! or, by the mass, I’ll strike!”
and Hagen added: “Be warned in time, ye knights
of Kriemhild! If you would have aught with us,
come with morning’s light and you shall find us
ready!”</p>

<p>Thereupon the Huns fell back, and the Burgundians
were shown into a wide vaulted hall where
ample provisions for their comfort had been made.
The beds were decked with gorgeous hangings of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
Arabian silk, tapestries from Arras, and coverlets of
ermine and rich sable. Yet all this splendor could
not avail to banish the dark forebodings that black
as night had settled upon the hearts of the Burgundians.
To the youthful imagination of Giselher
indeed, the sumptuously decked hall seemed to bear
the semblance of a tomb, and he cried aloud:
“Oh, woe to this hostelry, and woe to the Burgundians,
that ever they came to Kriemhild’s court!”</p>

<p>Whereupon a deep voice answered: “Dismiss
thy fears, Lord Giselher, for I will answer for thy
safe repose until the morn.”</p>

<p>It was Hagen who spoke, and such cheer did
his words bring that all laid them down in peace
forthwith to seek their much needed repose. But
Volker strode to Hagen’s side, saying: “An thou
so wilt, I’ll keep the watch with thee!”</p>

<p>“God will reward thy loyalty, my gallant friend!”
replied Hagen. “I need no help forsooth, yet
with thee by my side I could ask naught further.
Nor shalt thou fail of thanks one day, if my life be
spared.”</p>

<hr class="tiny">

<p>Then donning their heaviest armor they took
their place on the stone stairway without, to guard
the door. Now, Volker the bold was well skilled
in the minstrel art; not only was he master of
sword-play, but also of the sweet-toned viol, from
which he was never parted. Fetching it now, he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
seated himself in the arched doorway and began to
play. As the wondrous melodies floated on the air,
all the joys and sorrows of their past lives seemed
to fill once more the hearts of the sleeping heroes.
Soft and low, like the rustling of leaves in the evening
breeze, the last notes died away, and all was
still.</p>

<p>Then Volker exchanged the viol for the shield,
and the bow for the sword of battle. Motionless
the two knights stood on either side of the high
arched doorway, like giant figures cast in bronze.
Full dark was it, for few stars crept through the
cloudy veil which night had cast like a pall about
the weary strangers. Not long after midnight
Volker spied the gleam of armor in the distance,
and looking more closely, his sharp eyes soon discovered
some of Kriemhild’s knights lurking in the
darkness. Kriemhild had sent them thither with
orders to slay Hagen, but spare the other.</p>

<p>Volker pointed them out to his comrade, who
whispered: “Be silent now and let them approach.
Perchance they will not mark our presence here in
the dark shadow. When once they are within our
reach, we will smite their helms as they come up
the stair, and send them back to Kriemhild in sorry
plight.”</p>

<p>But when the Hunnish knights had advanced a
few steps they perceived the two watchers in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
doorway, whereupon one said: “Now must we
forego our purpose. Look, yonder stands the minstrel!
His burnished helm gleams with vivid light,
and sparks of living flame shoot from his mail.
Hagen stands beside him to guard the door. Now
of a truth those knights may safely rest for aught
of me!” Therewith they stole softly away. Then
Volker said: “What thinkest thou, Hagen? Shall
I not after them? Gladly would I play a brief tune
upon them with my sword-bow!”</p>

<p>“An thou lov’st me, do not so!” rejoined Hagen
quickly. “Wert thou sore pressed, then must I
hasten to thy aid and leave the door unguarded.”</p>

<p>But Volker persisted: “They shall know that we
have marked their base intent, and so perchance be
brought to shame.” Therewith he shouted scornfully:
“Wherefore so fully armed at dead of night,
O Kriemhild’s knights? Is it on highway robbery
you are bent?”</p>

<p>But the Huns made no answer; whereupon he
cried again in wrath: “Fie upon you, dastard,
craven crew, who sought to murder sleeping men!
Lay down those swords from hands no longer fit to
bear them!”</p>

<p>Thus once again was Kriemhild’s purpose brought
to naught, and she was forced to devise other measures
to gain her ends.</p>

<p><span class="drop-cap">S</span>O the night passed, nor did the Huns again
show themselves. “My armor grows chilly,”
said Volker, at last, “methinks the fresh
breeze betokens day is near.” And the two
sentinels went within to awaken the sleepers.</p>

<p>Soon thereafter the beams of the rising sun shone
into the hall, the bell for matins sounded, and Hagen
summoned the Burgundians to go to mass.
The knights were about to array themselves in festival
attire, but he bade them don their armor instead,
change their silk garments for hauberks, rich
mantles for shields, and jewelled caps for good steel
helms; for strife would surely come ere set of sun
and they must be prepared.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“Now go ye to the minster church,</div>
<div class="indent">Your sins there to confess;</div>

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>So it was that clad in full armor the Burgundians
took their way in procession to the minster. When
they were come to the churchyard, Hagen said:
“Hearken to my counsel, knights and princes!
We must be ever on our guard against the Huns,
wherefore it were well to keep in close array. Place
your shields before you, and should any chance
to offer evil greeting, see that his death stroke be
your thanks. If our courage fail not, our knightly
honor shall yet remain unstained, though all beside
be lost!” Thus man to man they stood, while
Hagen and Volker advanced to the church door
that they might thence keep watch of Kriemhild
and her men.</p>

<p>Soon came Etzel in all the splendor of his royal
robes, his beauteous wife Kriemhild at his side, followed
by a glittering train of knights, and not a
little surprised was he to behold the Burgundians
armed from head to heel. Still unaware of the dark
storm-clouds hourly gathering thicker and heavier
above the heads of his guests, he was troubled at
this sight, for it seemed that they misdoubted his
good faith; wherefore, seeing Hagen, he sought to
learn from him the cause thereof.</p>

<p>“Have any dealt you ill?” he asked; “if so,
then dearly shall they rue it!”</p>

<p>Now was Kriemhild stricken with terror lest Hagen
should betray her to the King; but far too<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
proud was the hero to seek help from Etzel and
thereby own he lacked the courage to defend himself.
So he replied: “Naught has befallen us, O
King. ’Tis but a custom we of Burgundy have, to
go full-armed for three days during every feast.”</p>

<p>Nor yet did Kriemhild reveal the truth to Etzel,
fearing he would forbid her vengeful purpose, and
thus her mortal enemy would once more escape
her. So they passed on, and behind them came
Kriemhild’s knights in spreading ranks. Neither
Hagen nor Volker would stir a handbreadth from
the path, and thereby ensued great crowding and
jostling. The Huns would fain have provoked a
conflict, but they feared the King’s wrath; and
presently all had passed into the church, the Burgundians
following last of all.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="drop-cap2">A</span>T midday all were summoned to the royal
feast, and the Huns likewise appeared in
full armor, whereat King Etzel’s wrath
arose. Whosoever deemed it fit to sit at
feast in arms, him should he not gainsay, he said,
but woe unto any who should hold designs against
his guests! During the feast Kriemhild left the
hall and summoning the prince of Bern and his
lion-hearted old warrior, Hildebrand, to her, spoke
with them privately. Bitterly she complained of
all her wrongs and besought them to avenge her.
But Hildebrand said: “No evil would I do the
knights of Burgundy for all the gold that one
could offer me!”</p>

<p>And Dietrich added: “King Günther’s kin never
wronged or injured me; wherefore my dishonor
were great did I now seek to stir up strife with
them.”</p>

<p>Therewith they returned to the hall, and Kriemhild
sent for Blödelin, the brother of the King, and
with passionate words urged him to vengeance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
against the traitor who had done her such foul
wrong; but as Etzel had made it plain that he held
the Burgundians as his friends, Blödelin feared to
incur his wrath. Thereupon Kriemhild promised
him much silver and gold and likewise the hand of
a fair dame, the widow of Sir Nudung, for whom
he long had sighed, and when she added thereto
the gift of rich lands, at last he yielded and swore
to do her will in all things.</p>

<p>“Now, by my faith, that false Hagen shall pay
for all thy wrongs!” he cried, “nor will I rest till
I have brought him to thy feet!”</p>

<p>Joyfully Kriemhild returned to the hall and
seated herself once more beside her lord. But
Blödelin went forthwith to his followers and bade
them arm, which they did right willingly, for
secretly they hated the Burgundians. Kriemhild in
her vengeful fury had bethought her of yet another
plan, and this was to cause her son Ortlieb to be
brought to her.</p>

<p>“Surely,” she thought, “will Hagen say evil
words about the child to excite my wrath and thus
affront my husband and his Hunnish kin, whereby
strife will ensue.” Accordingly, four of Etzel’s
knights were despatched to fetch the young prince
thither, whereat the King was greatly pleased.
Taking the boy by the hand, he said:</p>

<p>“My friends, behold my only son! I commend<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
him to your affection. Should he grow to be like his
kin, I shall have in him a bold and stalwart hero,
worthy in truth to wear my crown and fill his high
estate; for many a duke and king will one day do
him homage. Take him with you, I pray, unto
your court, that he may gain all knightly virtues
there in return for which will I give you hearty
thanks!”</p>

<p>Hagen replied: “If he lives to grow to man’s
estate, full many an honor well may be his; but as
to that, methinks I see an early death imprinted on
his brow!”</p>

<p>At these words terror seized the Burgundians,
who gladly would have had them left unsaid, but
Etzel gazed before him with a troubled look, and
spoke no word. Little did he surmise the frightful
thought in Hagen’s mind.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="drop-cap">N</span>OW, the charge of the Burgundian
following had been given to Dankwart,
the brother of Hagen, the same who in
former days had journeyed to Iceland for
the wooing of Brunhild; and Blödelin’s plan was to
overpower them first, and then attack the princes
and their knights. Accordingly he sought that remote
part of the castle wherein they had been
lodged, and asked for Dankwart. He was shown
into a hall where that hero with all his men was
seated at the board, and from the window of which
he had marked the approach of the band of armed
Huns. Greeting Blödelin with fair words, he asked
what brought him thither. “Nay, spare thy greetings,”
said Blödelin, coldly, “I come not in peace,
Sir Knight, but in good sooth to hold thee to account
for thy brother Hagen’s murder of the noble
Siegfried.”</p>

<p>“By my faith,” said Dankwart, “then would thy
vengeance overtake the guiltless, since I, as it
chanced, did abide at the royal court when Siegfried
met his death beside the spring.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>“What thou hast done concerns me naught,”
replied Blödelin, “it is enough that ’twas thy kinsman
did the deed; and therefore must thou die!”</p>

<p>“Gramercy!” quoth Dankwart, “methinks
’twere well I had spared my words”; and springing
from his seat he swung his sword aloft and at one
blow swept Blödelin’s head from his shoulders,
shouting: “Be this my marriage gift unto thy
bride!” For he had learned from a friendly Hun
of Kriemhild’s promise to Blödelin.</p>

<p>When the Huns saw their leader fall they burst
into the hall with howls of vengeance. Dankwart
shouted to his men to defend themselves to the
death and therewith began a terrible conflict.
Those of the Burgundians who had no swords
made weapons of whatever came to hand, but the
greater part were well armed, and so fiercely did
they fight that soon the Huns were driven from
the hall leaving more than a hundred of their dead
upon the floor and in the passage. But anon came
fresh bands of armed Huns, gathering from all
quarters and in such numbers, that their onslaught
could not long be withstood. Bravely as they fought,
the Burgundians at last were all slain save Dankwart.
Alone he stood and shouted: “Behold, ye
Huns! of all my men I only am yet alive! If you
are true knights, yield me passage to the open air,
that I may once more cool my brow before I fall.”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
But the Huns would not give way for him; whereupon
Dankwart laid about him so fiercely that soon
he made his way to the door and succeeded in gaining
the courtyard.</p>

<p>“Now would to God,” he cried, cleaving a pathway
before him step by step, “some messenger were
near to warn my brother Hagen of my need!”</p>

<p>Whereon the Huns shouted: “Thou thyself
shalt be the messenger when we shall fetch thee
dead into the royal hall! Then shall Etzel learn
that thou hast slain his brother Blödelin and with
him his liegemen!”</p>

<p>But Dankwart scorned their threats. “By the
mass, I’ll bear the news myself while yet I live!”
he cried; “I’ll stain many a Hunnish helm with
gore!” So furiously did he spring upon his foes
that they fell back before him and no longer dared
meet him at sword’s length, but hurled their javelins
at him from afar. His shield was soon so thickly
pierced with spears that he could not bear the
weight thereof, and so cast it off. Then they
ventured again to approach; but he smote so
fiercely and truly that none who came against
him returned. Ever nearer and nearer he made
his way to the royal hall. At last, weary and
breathless, the hero reached the palace. The terrified
servants let fall the cups and dishes that
they bore, and would have hastened to the hall<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
to tell the tale. But Dankwart cried: “Stay,
varlets! your task is but to carry wine and food
unto the feast! I will bear the news unto the
King!” Some among them sought to bar his
passage, but again his good sword marked a
path. Springing up the stairs, of a sudden the
hero appeared in the doorway of the vast hall
where the Burgundians ate at table with the
Huns.</p>

<p>Just at this moment it was that Hagen said
the young prince bore the marks of an early
death.</p>

<p>With one accord the knights sprang to their feet,
their swords flashing aloft, and Hagen cried fiercely:
“By Heaven! who hath done this slaughter?”</p>

<p>“Sir Blödelin and his men,” answered Dankwart;
“yet dearly hath he paid therefor; with mine own
hand I slew him.”</p>

<p>“It was more honor than he merited, thus to
meet his death by a hero’s hand.”</p>

<p>Now was Hagen’s resolution taken, and he
shouted: “Do thou, Dankwart, guard the door,
nor suffer any Hun to leave the hall, while I
hold a reckoning with these.”</p>

<p>Then springing to Kriemhild’s side, he cried:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
“Now let us drink to Siegfried’s repose! For
that, we need the King’s own wine!” Therewith
he struck off the head of the little prince. Then
lifting Balmung with both hands, he slew the attendant
of the prince, and a third stroke severed
the right hand of the minstrel Werbel, who had
borne King Etzel’s message to the Burgundians.
Volker sprang to his side, and there began
among the Hunnish knights “a slaughter grim
and great.”</p>

<p>King Günther and his brothers sought at first to
check the strife, but all in vain. Then they too
were seized with the fury of battle, and soon all the
Burgundians had joined the fray.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Huns had drawn their swords and
were bravely striving to defend themselves. Everywhere
through the hall rose the clash of arms, and
hoarse battle-cries reëchoed from the roof. From
without more Huns hurled themselves against the
door, eager to aid their comrades within; and
Dankwart, hard pressed, was fain to cry to Hagen
for aid. Whereupon that hero shouted in a voice
of thunder: “Friend Volker, haste thee to my
brother’s side, or we surely must lose a mighty
champion!”</p>

<p>Gladly sprang Volker to the door; and now so
fiercely did they ply their blades that no man lived
to pass within or out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Joyous above the battle din</div>
<div class="indent">The minstrel’s shout rang clear;</div>
<div class="verse">“The hall is now well closed, forsooth,</div>
<div class="indent">Good comrades, be of cheer!</div>
<div class="verse">King Etzel’s door is faster made</div>
<div class="indent">By Burgund heroes twain</div>
<div class="verse">Than if a thousand bolts were shot</div>
<div class="indent">To make all entry vain!”</div>
</div></div>

<p>Whereat Hagen flung his shield upon his back,
and again grasping Balmung with both hands, laid
about him more furiously than before. Fear came
upon Kriemhild, for she saw that the Burgundians
were stronger than the Huns; and turning in terror
to Dietrich of Bern, who stood near, she besought
him to aid her to escape.</p>

<p>“But how may that be done, O Queen,” replied
he. “So mad with fury are these heroes that even
I must fight for my life.”</p>

<p>But Kriemhild pressed him so sorely in her fear
that at length Dietrich promised he would seek to
save her; and leaping upon a table, he gave a
mighty shout. Clearly above the clash of arms
it sounded like the blast of a battle horn. It
caught King Günther’s ear, and knowing it for
Dietrich’s voice, he commanded the strife to cease
till he should learn the will of the hero, who made
signal with his hand that he would speak. For a
space there was silence while Günther asked whether
Dietrich or any of his knights had suffered ill.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>“Loath were I, noble knight, that such should
chance,” said he, “for surely no cause for strife lies
’twixt us two.”</p>

<p>Dietrich replied that no evil had befallen them;
he did but seek permission to withdraw with all his
men. This Günther gladly granted, whereupon
Dietrich, taking the Queen on one arm and King
Etzel on the other, retired from the hall, followed
by his knights; but no Huns were permitted to
depart with them. Then Rüdiger, who had welcomed
the Burgundians so hospitably on their way
thither, also sprang upon the table and asked if no
others might pass out. And Giselher, who was
betrothed to Rüdiger’s daughter, cried:</p>

<p>“Naught is there but peace between us, gallant
Rüdiger, for thou hast ever kept true faith with us
and never sought to do us harm.”</p>

<p>So Rüdiger with his followers also departed from
the hall in peace. A Hunnish knight had sought
to slip out unseen behind the King, but Volker
swiftly smote him dead upon the spot. When
King Etzel was once more without he stood and
cried aloud in grief:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“Now woe unto this peaceful feast!</div>
<div class="indent">And woe unto this day!</div>
<div class="verse">For there within is one doth rage</div>
<div class="indent">Like wild boar brought to bay.</div>
<div class="verse">This devil fierce is Volker hight</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
<div class="indent">A minstrel knight is he.</div>
<div class="verse">Thanks be to God that by his grace</div>

<div class="verse">His fearful melodies ring out</div>

<div class="verse">His viol bow is crimson red;</div>

<div class="indent">Howe’er his wrath began,</div>
<div class="verse">Sure ne’er had I so dread a guest</div>
<div class="indent">As this same minstrelman.”</div>
</div></div>

<p>And now fiercer and fiercer raged the strife. The
Burgundians showed no mercy. When the last
Hun was dead, the victors laid down their arms
and sat them down to draw breath, while Hagen
and Volker with drawn swords kept guard before
the door.</p>

<small><i>Iring’s Fight with Hagen</i></small></h2>
</div>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop-cap-p.jpg" width="60" height="75" alt="P">
</div>

<p><span class="drop-cap">P</span>RESENTLY Giselher spoke: “Not yet,
methinks, dear comrades, are our labors
ended, and many hours of warfare lie before
us ere we shall be overcome. But these
dead Huns greatly encumber us, wherefore let us
cast them out!” Hagen smiled grimly when he
heard the young prince’s words, for they pleased
him well.</p>

<p>Thereupon they seized the dead warriors and
flung them out. Etzel came to gaze upon the dead,
and Hagen, seeing him, cried out: “It were well,
methinks, O King of Huns, an thou didst wield the
sword and cheer thy people on, for they lack somewhat
of heart! Behold the work the blade of our
ruler hath wrought on helm and shield!”</p>

<p>At these words Etzel’s brow grew red with wrath
and shame, and he called for his arms; but Kriemhild
cried: “Nay, venture not thy life, dear lord!
Thy single arm were of small avail against yon
heroes. Rather heap thy shield with ruddy gold as
a prize to those Huns who will maintain the strife.”
But Etzel was no craven knight, and would have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
gone to do battle with Hagen had not his lords
withheld him by force.</p>

<p>Then Hagen taunted the Queen with scornful
words till her wrath against him rose hotter and
fiercer than before, and she cried to the Huns:
“On him who slayeth yon knight I will bestow the
King’s shield piled up with gold, and many a castle
and fruitful field besides.”</p>

<p>But none stirred; whereupon Volker mocked
them, saying ’twere shame in them to eat the King’s
bread, since none had courage to do his will, nor
could such dastards hope to gain their lord’s esteem,
but must hold themselves disgraced as knights
forsworn. The bravest of the Huns felt bitter
shame within them at the truth of Volker’s words,
and were roused to fresh fury; yet none dared lead
the attack. But there chanced to be a strange knight
at the court,—the Margrave Iring of Denmark,—and
he now stepped forth, saying: “I ever have been bent
on glorious deeds, nor will I fail now to strive for
such. Wherefore, Sir Hagen, arm thyself to meet me.”</p>

<p>Hagen sought to dissuade him from his purpose,
but Iring replied:</p>

<p>“I have encountered great odds heretofore, and
will not fail to meet them now”; and therewith
he donned his armor. Then Irnfried of Thuringia,
a valiant youth, and stout Hawart of Denmark,
made ready to aid him with their followers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>When Volker saw the band of armed men advancing
with the three knights at their head, he
said: “Now, of a truth, friend Hagen, doth not a
falsehood ill become a gallant knight? I thought
yon boastful Iring would have dared a single combat
with thee, and now behold, how well supported
he comes!”</p>

<p>But Iring, hearing this, replied, ’twas not his wont
to stain his knightly honor thus, and what he vowed
he would now fulfil. Whereupon his men stood
still and reluctantly allowed him to advance alone
to meet his foe.</p>

<p>Raising aloft their well-poised javelins, the two
champions hurled them at each other with such
mighty force and so true an aim that both shields
were pierced and the shafts snapped short, whereupon
they rushed together, their great swords clanging
sharply on the iron shields. So heavy were Sir
Iring’s strokes that fire leaped out beneath them, and
the clash of arms resounded through the hall, yet
of no avail were they against Hagen’s strength and
skill; whereupon, giving over the attempt, he fell
upon Günther; and then again baffled, upon Gernot.
At last, in a fury at finding himself no match
for these heroes he sprang at one of the Burgundian
knights and slew him and thereafter three others.</p>

<p>Now Giselher, beside himself with rage, longed
for vengeance, nor did he long in vain, for therewith<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
Iring rushed upon him, but Giselher smote him so
powerfully that he fell senseless to the floor. All
thought him dead, yet he was but stunned with the
crashing blow upon his helm; and suddenly springing
to his feet he rushed from the hall, smiting
Hagen as he reached the door, and wounding
him. Furious with rage, that hero grasped his
sword in both hands and pursued Sir Iring down
the stairs, striking sparks from his upraised shield.</p>

<p>Kriemhild, seeing the blood on Hagen’s helm,
greeted Iring joyfully; but Hagen shouted to her
to save her thanks until the knight should have
proved himself worthy of them by returning again
to the combat, warning her also that his wound was
but slight and had done him little harm as she should
soon learn. Thereupon Iring caused a new shield to
be brought, and hastily donning fresh armor he
rushed again to the stairway. Like a raging lion,
down sprang Hagen to meet him, striking such fearful
blows that naught could long withstand them.
Soon they shore through shield and helm and
wounded Iring. Higher he raised his shield to
guard his head, when Hagen, seizing a spear that
lay upon the ground, hurled it through the shield
and fatally pierced him. Back fled Iring to his
Danes and there sank dying at their feet, while
they crowded about him with cries of sorrow.
Kriemhild too bent over him weeping. He died<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
like a hero; yet ere his eyes grew dim he spoke
once more in warning to his followers:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“Those largesses which Etzel’s Queen</div>
<div class="verse">Did promise you to-day</div>
<div class="verse">Ne’er hope to conquer or to win</div>
<div class="verse">While holding mortal breath;</div>
<div class="verse">For he who fights with Hagen bold</div>
<div class="verse">Is sure to meet with death!”</div>
</div></div>

<p>Maddened with grief and rage by the death of
their chief, Irnfried and Hawart rushed headlong
on the Burgundians and another fierce fight began.
Soon Irnfried fell by Volker’s sword, and Hawart
by Hagen’s. Then Volker ordered that their followers
who were storming at the door be admitted
to the hall, and again the din of battle rose more
frightful than before. The Burgundians fought
like lions; nor, fiercely as the Danes and Thuringians
strove to avenge their lords, did one escape
the swords of Günther’s dauntless heroes.</p>

<p>Volker, the minstrel knight, took his place by
the palace door to watch for any new foe, but
there were none who dared attack them. The
Huns lacked courage, while Dietrich of Bern,
and Rüdiger, who had bold knights at their command,
not only shunned the strife but bitterly
lamented that it had ever occurred.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="drop-cap">N</span>OT long were the Burgundians to enjoy
repose, however, for fresh bodies of Huns
came pouring in from all sides, and soon
Etzel and Kriemhild had mustered another
force; nor was it easy to repel them, by reason
of their great numbers.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">The onslaught and defence did last</div>
<div class="indent">Till hindered by the night.</div>
<div class="verse">Those dauntless guests beyond all praise</div>
<div class="indent">With Etzel’s men did fight</div>
<div class="verse">The whole of one long Summer’s day—</div>
<div class="indent">So do the legends tell—</div>
<div class="verse">Hella! what thousands of brave men</div>
<div class="indent">By Burgund weapons fell.</div>
</div></div>

<p>Thus night came on, and gladly would the war-worn
heroes have sought a speedy death. Their
thoughts also turned toward peace, and they made
known to the Huns that they would have speech
with the King. Word was sent to Etzel, and
he forthwith appeared, with Kriemhild, before the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
palace, upon the stairway of which stood the three
princes in their blood-stained armor, and behind
them Hagen and Volker and Dankwart.</p>

<p>Then Etzel spoke: “What would ye have with
me? ’Twere vain to sue for peace, for never so
long as I have breath shall it be granted to those
who so cruelly have slain my only child and many
of my kin!”</p>

<p>Günther answered that it had been forced upon
them, while Giselher, turning to the Huns, cried
out:</p>

<p>“What charge against me do ye bring? Did I
not come hither in all peace and friendship to your
land?”</p>

<p>The knights replied: “Already hath such friendship
cost us dear! Full many a widowed wife and
orphaned child have bitter cause to wish thou ne’er
hadst left the Rhine!”</p>

<p>Again Günther sought to make peace; but Etzel
would hear naught thereof. “Your griefs are not
as mine,” he said, “for to my loss is added shame;
nor may it be effaced save with your blood. Wherefore,
I say, not one of you shall depart hence with
his life!”</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Then said the youthful Giselher:</div>
<div class="indent">“O beauteous sister mine,</div>
<div class="verse">I little treachery feared when thou</div>
<div class="indent">Didst bid me cross the Rhine.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
<div class="first">“To thee I’ve ever faithful been,</div>
<div class="indent">Nor grief nor sorrow wrought,</div>
<div class="verse">Believing that thou heldst me dear,</div>
<div class="indent">To bring thee joy I sought.</div>
<div class="verse">Nor can I think thou’lt wish me ill;</div>
<div class="indent">Be still my sister true!</div>
<div class="verse">With kindly judgment look on us,</div>
<div class="indent">Sure less thou canst not do.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Once more a ray of love warmed Kriemhild’s
sorely wounded heart, and she replied:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“Now if Sir Hagen you’ll agree</div>
<div class="indent">Into my hands to give,</div>
<div class="verse">Then will I not refuse to grant</div>
<div class="indent">That ye three all shall live;</div>
<div class="verse">Since ye in truth my brethren are</div>
<div class="indent">And from one mother spring,</div>
<div class="verse">Of further mercy I’ll consult</div>
<div class="indent">With those about the King.”</div>
</div></div>

<p>“Now, Heaven forbid!” cried Gernot. “Far
rather death than such disloyalty!”</p>

<p>And Giselher said: “Never yet did I break faith
with comrade, nor will I fail to-day in knightly duty.”</p>

<p>Thus was the last spark of affection extinguished
in Kriemhild’s bosom. She no longer felt pity
even for her own kin, since they had refused to
deliver over to her the slayer of her Siegfried and
her child. Summoning the Huns, she bade them
fire the palace on all sides.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>Now was it in truth a night of terror for the
Burgundians. Blazing shafts flew on to the roof, and
soon it was wrapped in flame. Thick smoke and
fiery vapors filled the hall, and the heroes suffered
tortures. Gladly would they have welcomed a swift
death in battle. Many called on God to pity their
distress, and one knight cried out woefully for a
drop of water. Hagen shouted: “Keep to the
walls, my comrades, and raise your shields aloft!”</p>

<p>And still that dauntless hero, with the brave
Volker, kept unceasing watch before the door. At
daybreak Volker said to Hagen: “Let us within,
and then perchance the watchful Huns will think
we have perished.”</p>

<p>And so in truth did Etzel and Queen Kriemhild
now believe. Yet still six hundred of them were
alive. When this news was brought to Kriemhild
she caused a great store of gold to be brought and
divided among the Huns, with which to spur their
valor. Thereupon a thousand of the boldest rushed
to the assault; but though many of the Burgundians
too were slain, not one of Kriemhild’s warriors
came forth from that dread hall of death to
claim his gold.</p>

<small><i>The Margrave Rüdiger</i></small></h2>
</div>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/dropcap-s.jpg" width="50" height="75" alt="S">
</div>

<p><span class="drop-cap">S</span>OON thereafter came Sir Rüdiger, and when
he beheld the smoking, roofless palace, so
filled with sorrow was his noble heart at all
the evil wrought and yet to come, that tears
fell from his eyes and trickled down his long gray
beard. Hoping that something might yet be done
to bring about a reconciliation, he sent a message to
Dietrich of Bern, saying: “Let us go together unto
the King; perchance we may prevail upon him to
forego his wrath.”</p>

<p>But Dietrich, who also deeply lamented what had
befallen, sent back word that it was useless, for Etzel
would not hear of peace on any terms, nor might any
venture now to speak thereof to him. As Rüdiger
stood leaning on his sword, his mournful gaze fixed
upon the Queen, a Hunnish knight observed him
and said scornfully to Kriemhild: “See, yonder
stands Sir Rüdiger! Etzel hath shown favor to
him and richly dowered him with lands and gold,
yet hath he not struck a blow in all this strife!
Renowned is he for skill and valor. Methinks such<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
fame can be of little worth since we have not seen
him display either here.”</p>

<p>Rüdiger overheard these words and was seized
with a mighty wrath thereat. Clinching his fist he
smote the insolent scoffer with such giant force that
he dropped lifeless at his feet.</p>

<p>At that same moment Etzel appeared in the courtyard.
“How now, Sir Knight?” he cried, “that is
an evil deed of thine. Are there not dead enough,
forsooth, that thou shouldst seek to add to them?”</p>

<p>The Queen too was about to reproach him bitterly,
when suddenly she bethought her of the vow Rüdiger
made to her when he came to Worms to urge King
Etzel’s suit. “Bethink thee of thy oath, Sir Rüdiger,”
she cried, solemnly. “Didst thou not swear to serve
me loyally and faithfully to avenge all my wrongs?”</p>

<p>“That did I truly, most noble lady,” replied
Rüdiger, “nor would I fail to risk my life in thy
cause. But ’tis my soul that I should lose were I
to be at strife with these thy guests, for ’twas as
friends I brought them hither to thy court!”</p>

<p>Yet still the Queen demanded vengeance on her
foes, and Etzel thereto joined his prayers, till Rüdiger
in bitter anguish cried:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="first">“Oh, woe is me, forsaken one,</div>
<div class="indent">That ever I was born!</div>
<div class="verse">Oh, woe’s the day, that I must be</div>
<div class="indent">Of all my honor shorn!</div>
<div class="verse">Of truth and gentleness of mind</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
<div class="indent">Which God to me did give.</div>
<div class="verse">Oh, God! that I might only die!</div>
<div class="indent">I fain would cease to live.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="first">“Whichever duty I avoid,</div>
<div class="indent">The other to fulfil,</div>
<div class="verse">I’m counted dastardly and base,</div>

<div class="verse">Yet leave I both of them undone,</div>
<div class="indent">I with the world have strife.</div>
<div class="verse">May He vouchsafe to counsel me,</div>
<div class="indent">Who first did give me life!”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>He besought the King to take back all the lands
and honors that he held in fee, and let him retire
with his followers to his castle, a poor man, rather
than force him to attack the friends whom he had
welcomed in all love and loyalty, who had slept
beneath his roof, and to one of whom indeed his
daughter was betrothed. But he pleaded in vain,
for Kriemhild firmly held him to his word, while
the King promised him still greater riches and
honor if he would rid him of his foes.</p>

<p>At last Rüdiger yielded. He agreed to keep his
oath and give his life in payment for the kindnesses
he had received from his sovereigns; he commended
his wife and daughter to their care, then sorrowfully
sought his followers and bade them arm for battle
with the Burgundians.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>When Volker saw the band of knights approaching,
his heart sank, but Giselher cried joyfully:
“Well for us all was it that I was betrothed to
Rüdiger’s daughter, for now our gallant friend comes
to bring us peace!”</p>

<p>“Nay, my lord! he who brings peace comes not
in this array,” replied Volker.</p>

<p>Pausing before the palace, Rüdiger placed his
shield upon the ground, but no friendly greeting
did he pay the Burgundians as was his wont. In
lieu thereof he renounced his loyalty to them and
challenged them to combat. Great was their distress
thus to be forced to strife with friends after struggling
against so many foes; and Günther cried:
“Now Heaven forbid, Sir Knight, that thou
shouldst do our friendship such wrong!”</p>

<p>“There is no help for it, alas!” replied Rüdiger,
“since the Queen demands of me fulfilment of a
vow!”</p>

<p>Then said Gernot: “This sword was thy gift to
me, most noble Rüdiger, when thou didst welcome
us beneath thy roof; never hath it failed me in
time of need, and shall I turn it now against thee,
the giver, to bring thy noble wife to widowhood?”</p>

<p>“Would to God that I indeed were dead!” cried
Rüdiger. “If thou go safe from hence, full well I
know thou wilt bring comfort to my wife and
daughter.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>Then commending himself to God, he lifted his
shield and was about to rush into the hall, when
Hagen shouted to him from the stairway: “Behold,
Sir Rüdiger, my sorry plight! This shield, which
thy wife gave me in happier hours, hath been so
hacked and hewed by hostile Huns that no longer
may it serve for my defence. Had I another such as
that which thou dost bear, I would go undismayed
again to battle!”</p>

<p>Loath as was Rüdiger to give away his own
shield under the Queen’s eyes and thereby incur
her wrath, his noble heart could not withstand his
friend’s appeal, and he bestowed it on Hagen, saying:
“Take it, Sir Knight, and mayst thou bear it
back to Burgundy in memory of me!”</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">That Rüdiger so courteously,</div>

<div class="indent">No more could bold knight crave</div>
<div class="verse">In token of the courtesy</div>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">However grim Sir Hagen was,</div>
<div class="indent">Or ill-disposed in mind,</div>

<div class="indent">So noble and so kind,</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
<div class="verse">When near his end had given him,</div>
<div class="indent">His stubborn heart subdued;</div>
<div class="verse">While many a lofty knight did sigh,</div>
<div class="indent">As that brave act he viewed.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Said Hagen: “May the Lord of Heaven</div>
<div class="indent">Sir Rüdiger protect!</div>
<div class="verse">When he shall die, his like on earth</div>
<div class="indent">We may no more expect:</div>
<div class="verse">For he to homeless, shieldless knight</div>
<div class="indent">His own defence did give;</div>
<div class="verse">May God vouchsafe that when no more,</div>
<div class="indent">His virtues still shall live!”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Then he added: “As for thyself, brave Rüdiger,
though thou shouldst slay us every one, yet never
shall this sword be raised against thy life.” And
this stout Volker also swore.</p>

<p>Seizing his arms, Rüdiger rushed upon the Burgundians
and the strife began once more. Hagen
and Volker stood aside, nor did Giselher seek to
meet his sword; but deep were the wounds it dealt,
and many the knights that fell before it. Rüdiger’s
liegemen followed him, and soon the hall was filled
with the din of battle.</p>

<p>When Gernot saw the terrible havoc Rüdiger’s
sword wrought among the Burgundians, he shouted:
“I pray thee, cease, Sir Rüdiger! Now must I
seek vengeance for my true liegemen thou hast
slain and thereby turn thy gift against thyself!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>Therewith they cut their way through the press
of battle till they stood face to face. Fast fell the
strokes of sword on shield and helm, till Rüdiger,
whirling his sword aloft, smote Gernot; and as
Gernot received his death wound he grasped his
sword with both hands and dealt Rüdiger the
mightiest blow that ever he had struck. Both heroes
fell, slain at the same moment by each other’s
hands.</p>

<p>When Hagen saw this, his wrath was terrible to
behold, and he swore Rüdiger’s men should pay
dearly therefor, while loud were the lamentations of
the princes for the death of their brother. Mad
with fury now, they rushed upon the foe, nor was
it long ere the last man lay dead.</p>

<p>Now once more there was silence, and those who
were left of the Burgundians laid aside their arms
to rest them after the fierce struggle. Meanwhile
Etzel and Kriemhild waited without, expecting each
moment to see Rüdiger come forth with word that
the Burgundians were slain. But when all grew
still again she began to doubt that hero, and cried
aloud that he had deceived her and made peace with
her foes. Whereat Volker shouted wrathfully: “If
I dared to give the lie to lady such as thou, O
Queen, I would right willingly! So loyally hath
Rüdiger kept faith with thee that here he lieth
dead with all his knights. An thou art loath to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
trust my word, then may thine own eyes banish
doubt.”</p>

<p>Therewith the body was borne out by four
knights and laid upon the stairs. When Etzel beheld
this, he cried aloud with grief, while from all
the Huns arose such wails and plaints of woe that
they spread far beyond the court, and tower and
hall reëchoed with the cries.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="drop-cap4">O</span>NE of Dietrich’s knights heard the doleful
sound and hastened to his master,
crying: “I pray thee, lord, give ear!
Etzelburg gives forth such cries of woe
and lamentation as never yet have I heard. I fear
the Burgundians have slain the King or Kriemhild!”</p>

<p>The knights all sprang to their feet, with swords
aloft, but Dietrich said: “Draw not your swords,
my faithful liegemen, nor judge too rashly those of
Burgundy, for I have peace with them. Stern
necessity has compelled them to do much that they
have done.”</p>

<p>Then stepped forth Wolfhart, the boldest and
fiercest of the knights. In former days he had met
Hagen in battle and sorely wounded him, and now
he sought leave to go and learn what had befallen.
This would not Dietrich grant, however, for he
feared lest the fiery Wolfhart should affront the
Burgundians with too hasty words. He despatched
Helferich instead, who soon returned with the grievous
news of Rüdiger’s death. Horror-stricken,
Dietrich cried: “God forbid that such report should<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
be true! Sir Rüdiger always held yon heroes dear
in his regard, as well I know. How then could he
have earned such reward of them?”</p>

<p>Wolfhart shouted furiously: “Now, by my
faith, an they have slain that chief who hath done
us many a service, they shall die,—aye, every man!”</p>

<p>Thereupon Dietrich bade the ancient Hildebrand
go to the Burgundians and learn more nearly of
the matter, while overcome with grief he sat by the
window to wait his return. As Hildebrand was
about to depart, Wolfhart cried: “Nay, go not thus
unarmed, good master, or perchance yon haughty
chiefs will send thee back with insult. But an
they see thou canst defend thyself, then they will
spare thee such attack.”</p>

<p>So the old hero donned mail and helm, and taking
his sword and shield, rode forth. But the
knights all followed, likewise fully armed; and when
he asked the cause thereof, they said they would not
that he came to harm. Meanwhile the Burgundians
had borne the body of Rüdiger back within
the hall; and as Volker spied Hildebrand and the
knights, he warned his comrades of their approach.
Whereupon Günther and Giselher strode to the
window, Hagen following.</p>

<p>The warriors drew rein in the courtyard, while
Hildebrand lowered his shield and asked in
Dietrich’s name if it was indeed true that they had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
slain Sir Rüdiger. For such foul wrong, he added,
might not go unavenged.</p>

<p>Hagen replied: “Heartily do I wish, Sir Hildebrand,
that thou hadst been deceived. Yet it is true,
alas! Noble Rüdiger lies dead in this hall, nor can
his loss be bewailed too deeply!”</p>

<p>Then arose a great cry of woe from Dietrich’s
band, and many a bearded warrior’s cheeks were
wet with tears.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">For sobbing, noble Hildebrand</div>
<div class="indent">No question more could ask:</div>
<div class="verse">Said he: “Now, knights, perform the will</div>
<div class="indent">Of him who set the task!</div>
<div class="verse">Give us, from out the hall forthwith</div>
<div class="indent">Sir Rüdiger again,</div>
<div class="verse">Whose death is cause of so much grief</div>
<div class="indent">To all these warlike men.</div>
<div class="verse">That we repay by obsequies</div>
<div class="indent">His martial feats of yore</div>
<div class="verse">And noble friendship shown to us,</div>
<div class="indent">Now lost forevermore.”</div>
</div></div>

<p>And Günther consented to this; but Wolfhart,
who could no longer contain his wrath, demanded
with threatening gestures how long they were to
beg and wait for what they sought. Volker replied
that none should bring it to them now; if they
would have Rüdiger’s body they must come with
their swords and fetch it themselves from out the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
hall. He added: “Such service, methinks, were
but Sir Rüdiger’s due.”</p>

<p>Furious at this, Wolfhart would have rushed at
Volker, but Hildebrand withheld him by force.
“Nay—curb thy headlong wrath! or thou wilt
surely bring disgrace upon us all!”</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“Let loose, good master Hildebrand,</div>
<div class="indent">That lion of rash mood,</div>
<div class="verse">That he may come within my reach!”</div>
<div class="indent">So said the minstrel good,</div>
<div class="verse">“And though he may have slain a host</div>
<div class="indent">Of valiant knights before,</div>
<div class="verse">I’ll smite him such a stinging blow</div>
<div class="indent">That he’ll reply no more.”</div>
</div></div>

<p>These words filled Dietrich’s men with rage,
while Wolfhart with a fierce shout tore himself free
and like a raging lion leapt upon his foe, followed
by all the knights. But old Hildebrand was there
before him, “for since to fighting it must come—himself
would be the first.” Straight on Hagen he
rushed, and therewith arose a mighty clashing of
sword on shield, while the sparks flew in showers.
Yet soon were they parted by the tide of battle that
surged about them. So terrible was the din, it was
as that of a thousand forges. Bravely did they
fight on either side, but Günther and Giselher,
Hagen and his brother Dankwart, and Volker,
outdid all the rest. Now Hildebrand saw Volker<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
slay Sir Dietrich’s kinsman Siegestab, and thirsting
for vengeance, the old warrior sprang upon him.
Not long could he withstand such furious onslaught,
and soon thereby did the brave minstrel meet his
end. At the same moment also was Dankwart
slain by Helferich. When Hagen saw both Volker
and his brother dead, he swore most fearfully to
avenge their fall, and therewith he rushed into the
thickest of the fray, slaying right and left, and
smiting so fiercely that all his former efforts seemed
but as play.</p>

<p>But stout heroes were not lacking among
Dietrich’s warriors, and surely was there never seen so
mighty and so dire a combat. Thrice had the fiery
Wolfhart encircled the hall, hewing down all before
him, when he encountered Giselher. Fiercely the
young prince sprang at him, and so truly and so
mightily he smote that his sword clove Wolfhart’s
shield and hauberk. Yet summoning all his
strength, the dying hero dealt Giselher too his death
stroke so that he fell lifeless at his feet. When
Hildebrand saw his nephew Wolfhart fatally smitten
he sprang quickly to his side and sought to bear
him from the hall.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Then said the wounded-unto-death:</div>
<div class="indent">“Kind uncle, all is o’er!</div>
<div class="verse">No help canst thou or any one</div>
<div class="indent">Render to Wolfhart more.</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
<div class="verse">One parting word I leave with thee—</div>
<div class="indent">Beware of Hagen’s brand;</div>
<div class="verse">He has in heart and arm a power</div>
<div class="indent">That nothing may withstand.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“If that my friends, when I am dead,</div>
<div class="indent">Do weep and mourn for me,</div>
<div class="verse">Then to my best and nearest kin</div>
<div class="indent">Say, with much clemency,</div>
<div class="verse">That they desist from heart-lament,</div>
<div class="indent">Nor of my fall complain,</div>
<div class="verse">For that I found a glorious death</div>
<div class="indent">And was by king’s hand slain.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>And therewith he died.</p>

<p>At last, in all the great hall there were but three
heroes left alive,—Günther, Hagen, and Hildebrand.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Then Hagen smote Sir Hildebrand,</div>
<div class="indent">For that he Volker slew;</div>
<div class="verse">The ancient chief did ward his blows</div>
<div class="indent">With skill and courage too.</div>
</div></div>

<p>Yet could he not prevail against the might of
the Burgundian hero, but soon received a grievous
wound from Balmung’s flashing blade; whereupon,
using his shield for cover, he turned and fled to the
courtyard without.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Now lived of all those stalwart knights</div>
<div class="indent">No more than these bold two:</div>
<div class="verse">Günther, the King of Burgundy,</div>
<div class="indent">And Hagen keen and true.</div>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>Sorrowfully sat Dietrich in his chamber meanwhile,
hoping for better news from Hildebrand.
Little was he aware that his knights had followed
the old warrior, and still less that all by
the Burgundians’ swords were slain. Wherefore,
when Hildebrand appeared before him, his armor
stained with blood, the hero shrank aghast and
sternly asked if he had been at strife with the
Burgundians against his strict commands. Hildebrand
replied that Hagen had wounded him, and
barely had he escaped with his life from that arch-fiend.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Then said Sir Dietrich, haughtily:</div>
<div class="indent">“Thou hast been rightly served;</div>
<div class="verse">For thou didst know that from these guests</div>
<div class="indent">My friendship never swerved;</div>
<div class="verse">Also thou hast infringed the peace</div>
<div class="indent">I proffered with my breath:</div>
<div class="verse">Were’t not that ’twould be lasting shame,</div>
<div class="indent">Thou shouldst atone by death.”</div>
</div></div>

<p>Then Hildebrand sought to excuse himself, saying
they had but asked for the body of Rüdiger, and this
the Burgundians had refused them. When Dietrich
thus learned that Rüdiger indeed was dead he abandoned
himself to grief, but after a space asked by
whose hand he fell. Hildebrand replied that Gernot
had slain him, and by his hand, in turn, had been
slain. Thereupon Dietrich resolved to go himself
and have speech with the Burgundians; and calling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
for his armor, he bade Hildebrand summon his
knights forthwith.</p>

<p>“Alas! my lord,” cried Hildebrand, “thou seest
before thee all thy warriors!” And while Dietrich
gazed at him horror-stricken, he told him all that
had passed.</p>

<p>Now was Dietrich indeed plunged in sorrow.
Loudly did he lament the loss of Wolfhart and
all his brave knights, and cried: “This is the last
day of my joy on earth!”</p>

</div>

<p><span class="drop-cap">W</span>HEN Dietrich of Bern had regained his
wonted composure he asked how many
of the Burgundians yet were left alive,
and Hildebrand told him none save
Günther and Hagen,—all the rest were slain. Whereupon,
filled with grief and wrath, he seized his arms
and went forth with Hildebrand to seek them.</p>

<p>Leaning against the arched doorway stood the
two Burgundian heroes, their shields before them
on the ground; and when they saw the knights
approaching, Hagen, still undaunted, declared himself
ready to do battle with Sir Dietrich; nor did he
fear to meet him, mighty as he deemed himself, for
then would it be proved who was the better knight.</p>

<p>Dietrich heard this bold speech, but vouchsafed no
reply. Laying down his shield and looking sorrowfully
at them, he asked: “Wherein, O knights of
Burgundy, have I injured you, that you should slay
the noble Rüdiger, and with him all my friends and
warriors?”</p>

<p>“Not all the blame lies with us, Sir Knight,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
said Hagen, “for to this hall thy men came in
arms. Thou hast been misinformed.”</p>

<p>“Alas!” replied Dietrich, “I know only too well
what passed; for Hildebrand but now brought me
word that he desired of you the corpse of Rüdiger,
and you treated his suit with scorn.”</p>

<p>“Now, by my faith,” cried Günther, “’twas in
despite of Etzel that we refused; but forthwith
Wolfhart grew insolent, and thus it came to strife.”</p>

<p>Then said Dietrich: “Günther of Burgundy, for
the evil thou hast wrought, methinks thou owest
me some amends, and thou likewise, Sir Hagen.
If you will yield yourselves captives to my sword,
then I will guard you from the wrathful Huns,—at
peril of my life, if need be.”</p>

<p>“God in heaven forbid,” cried Hagen, “that two
such knights should give up their trusty swords
while alive and well armed withal!”</p>

<p>But again Dietrich urged them to accept his
terms, and Hildebrand added: “God knows, Sir
Hagen, there is little need for shame in such atonement.
And soon, it may be, the hour will come
when you would gladly obtain such peace.”</p>

<hr class="tiny">

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="drop-cap"><i>DEATH OF KRIEMHILD</i></p></figcaption>
</figure>
<hr class="tiny">

<p>“In faith,” replied Hagen, scornfully, “I would
indeed accept such terms ere I, like thee, would fly
full-armed, from a single knight.” Hildebrand
would have returned this taunt, but Dietrich forbade
them thus to bandy words like two old<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>
market-wives, and turning to Hagen he said, sternly:
“Tell me, valiant hero, did I hear aright that you
wished to measure swords with me?”</p>

<p>Well as he knew Sir Dietrich’s giant strength, he
could not gainsay this; wherefore he replied that he
would willingly abide the issue of a combat with
him, so his good Nibelung sword did not fail him.</p>

<p>Thereupon Dietrich raised his shield as signal
for attack, and Hagen sprang fiercely down to
meet him, the sword of the Nibelungs ringing loudly
on the stout shield of his foe. Sir Dietrich, too, was
well aware of Hagen’s might, and sought at first with
caution merely to ward his powerful blows, yet did
he lose no chance for skilful sword-strokes here and
there. At last he dealt stout Hagen such a deadly
wound that powerless he sank upon the ground. Then
casting his sword and shield aside, Dietrich quickly
bound him fast and led him thus unto the Queen.</p>

<p>Now, indeed, did Kriemhild’s joy and triumph
know no bounds. Vowing her lasting gratitude to
Dietrich, she promised to reward him well that he
had thus delivered up her deadly foe into her hands.
But Dietrich urged her to spare Sir Hagen, saying:
“Be merciful, O Queen! and it may chance that one
day he shall make amends to thee for all thy wrongs.”</p>

<p>To this Kriemhild made no reply, but ordered
Hagen to be put in chains and cast into a dungeon
where none might see him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>Meanwhile Günther loudly called for Dietrich,
that he might avenge Hagen’s downfall. Soon he
returned and then followed another fierce encounter;
but though Günther fought with the courage of
despair, he was overpowered at last, as Hagen
had been, and taken before the Queen.</p>

<p>Kriemhild bade him welcome; but Günther replied:
“Small thanks will I bestow on thee for thy
greetings, for well I know they bode us little good.”</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Then said the gallant prince of Bern:</div>
<div class="indent">“Most high and potent Queen!</div>
<div class="verse">There ne’er appeared as captive bound</div>
<div class="indent">So brave a knight, I ween,</div>
<div class="verse">As he whom unto thee I gave</div>
<div class="indent">With loyal courtesy,</div>
<div class="verse">At thy fair hands let him partake</div>
<div class="indent">Of favor due to me!”</div>
</div></div>

<p>Kriemhild declared she would perform his wish;
whereupon Dietrich departed, his eyes wet with
tears. But no thought had she for aught save
vengeance. Causing Günther to be also chained
and cast into a separate dungeon, she betook herself
to Hagen. Again she demanded of him her treasure,
promising him his life if he would confess where
he had hidden it.</p>

<p>Hagen, although a captive, wounded and in
chains, was still undaunted. With a scornful glance
at Kriemhild he replied: “I gave a solemn oath to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
my lord Günther, that never while he drew breath
would I divulge the spot where it lies.”</p>

<p>“Now will I quickly make an end of that, forsooth!”
cried Kriemhild; and thereupon she ordered
Günther’s head to be struck off. Then she took
it to Hagen, saying: “Now doth thy lord no longer
live and thereby art thou freed from thy sworn oath!”</p>

<p>But Hagen cried:</p>

</div>
